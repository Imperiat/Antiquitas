# Antiquitas
How to manually install the mod and/or play development patches: 

1. Create a new mod in the Imperator:Rome launcher and name it whatever you want

2. Download this program: https://desktop.github.com/ and install it.

3. Once installed, open it and click on "file" in the upper left of your screen.

4. Afterwards, press "clone repository". Look for the url tab and put in this: https://github.com/Imperiat/Antiquitas

5. For the location, change it to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Imperator\mod\(modname) (Navigate it yourself and make sure it doesn't get put in a subfolder. The "modname" should be the mod you created in step one. Do not use capitalization in the name and manually verify the local path.) If you have done all that, press clone.

6. Once the cloning is complete, make sure the branch selected is called "main" and everything should be finished. Boot up the game with the mod you created to test if it worked.

7. Whenever you want to update the mod to the latest patch, press the button next to it to fetch origin.
