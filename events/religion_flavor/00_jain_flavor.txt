#The first Jain council was held in Pataliputra during the reign of Chandragupta. This would occur sometime after the famine had begun and Sthulabhadra made his ruling on clothes. The council would be split between two factions, Svetambara and Digambara. While the council's main objective of putting ink to parchment of the various teachings of Mahavira, hence the creation of the Angas, the factions would lead to a split in Jainism. The player is given the choice of siding with one of the factions or trying to find a compromise.

#From this point onwards, Jains should have one of two traits: Svetembara and Digambara. With a minor opinion penalty for being of the different group. Also only men should be able to become Digambara monks, while females would be able to become Svetembara nuns, so only female jains with the Svetembara trait should get options to become nuns.
