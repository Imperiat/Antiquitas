 hellenistic_heritage:0 "Héritage hellénistique"
 hellenistic_heritage_desc:0 "Si les colons grecs ont voyagé vers l'est durant des générations avant Alexandre le Grand, c'est sa conquête de l'Empire achéménide qui a permis la formation des États grecs d'Orient. La fusion des cultures grecques et perses que souhaitait le Conquérant a perduré, et est l'une des marques incontestables de l'héritage hellénistique."
 #Vanilla Dahae Heritage
 arsacid_dahae_heritage:0 "Héritage dahéen"
 arsacid_dahae_heritage_desc:0 "Notre peuple s'enorgueillit de ses talents de cavalier et de sa connaissance de la monte. Nobles et humbles apprennent à chevaucher dès le plus jeune âge, aussi la puissance de notre cavalerie fait-elle trembler jusqu'aux empires les plus puissants. Mais notre vie de nomades a habitué nombre d'entre nous à une existence indépendante, ce qui explique que les chefs et les nobles aient tous une grande autonomie dans leurs propres affaires et un avis affirmé sur le gouvernement de notre peuple."

 desert_heritage:0 "Desert Heritage"
 desert_heritage_desc:0 "The ancestors of this people have traversed open deserts for many generations and over time built traditions and an almost instinct based understanding for how to survive and thrive among the hot dunes.

 #From Ben Heritages
 plateau_heritage:0 "Héritage des plateaux"
 plateau_heritage_desc:0 "Des hauts plateaux de Perse à ceux du Tibet, ce peuple s'est adapté à la vie dans ces terres difficiles. Ils ont une connaissance approfondie de ce qui est nécessaire à la survie, et peuvent l'exploiter afin d'éloigner les envahisseurs. Cependant, peu habitués aux flots tumultueux, leurs navires auront tendance à fuir s'ils sont engagés dans un combat."
