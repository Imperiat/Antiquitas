It has enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city due to its position on the land route from Europe to Asia and the sea route from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean."

Following the death of [GetCharacter('(int32)39').GetName] 20 years ago, Rhodes formed strong commercial and cultural ties with Alexander's general [GetCharacter('(int32)42').GetName] in Egypt. These ties would ultimately result in [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetName], basileus of the Antigonid Kingdom, to send his son [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetName] to lay siege to the island of Rhodes.\n\n With countless thousands of men and hundreds of ships [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetName] would lead a nearly year long siege against our great city. The Antigonid army constructed a great siege tower like no man had seen before, at 130 feet tall the tower took over 3,600 men just to move. The army eventually was able to breech the outer walls of the city after many months of heavy fighting with heavy losses on both sides.\n\n In a final effort the people of Rhodes hastily constructed a second wall now known as the Acropolis of Rhodes. It was within the acropolis that the people of Rhodes would bravely fight and repel multiple frontal assaults from the Antigonid forces. Only a few weeks ago [GetCharacter('(int32)38').GetName] was finally ordered to stop the siege by [GetCharacter('(int32)37').GetName], the people of Rhodes now stand victorious. However, the year long siege has devastated our once prosperous island and much must be done to bring it back to it's former glory."

The city of Altinum is a flourishing trading center located along the Amber Road, a trade route where amber from the distant Baltic Sea is transported south to the Mediterranean. A year ago a fleet commanded by the Spartan prince Cleonymus attempted to raid prosperous Veneto settlements, however the Veneti fought back destroying the Spartan ships. The Veneti have been in reoccurring conflict with Gallic tribes who have now settled on land previously inhabited by Italic nations. Veneto must move quickly to secure allies if it is to emerge successful and crush all future incursions."

Their economy is boosted by the lucrative trade of amber and furs. For thousands of years amber has been carried by traders from the Baltic coast to the Adriatic Sea along the amber road, from where it has been shipped as far as Egypt and Syria. For warfare the Veneti prefer traveling fast on foot, using spears or iron swords with wooden shields for battle. Roaming barbarian hordes present a significant threat when they raid Veneti territory along the northern and eastern borders. Will the Veneti tribes stand united against the growing Germanic tribes across the Vistula river to the west?"

Those that remain live in longhouses, sometimes grouped together into villages, with animals such as cattle, goats and horses kept indoors over winter. Settlements tend to be concentrated near the sea, where fish and shellfish are an abundant source of food. Scandinavian built ships are propelled with long paddles, with larger vessels carrying merchants south to trade leather and amber with continental nations. Will the Scandinavian tribes stand united against the growing power of the southern Germanic tribes?"
