 omen_brihaspati_desc:0 "The great Guru and Sage of Fire! Ho, Brihaspati comes to counsil all, from the devas, to his followers, and to the planets themselves!\n\nBrihaspati was likely originally a real person, and from his teachings came the religion of #E Charvaka#!. He would remain a popular figure even to those who primarily believe in the Vedas. He would become something of a god of fire, often identified with Agni. He would be referenced heavily in Brihaspati Sutras. Despite the text #R rejecting#! the Vedas, it would be quoted by other #E Shramanic#! faiths as well as #E Vedicism#!. Brihaspati would preach about #Y Anti-Theism#! and #Y Materialism#!, which are two of the founding principles of #E Charvaka#! and is often credited as the #G founder#! of the ideology itself, though this is debated."

 omen_yajnavalkya:0 "Yajnavalkya"
 omen_yajnavalkya_desc:0 "Yajnavalkya or Yagyavalkya was a Vedic-Charvaka sage. He would famously declare to female philosopher and contemporary, Maitreyi, that there is no conciousness after death, and that reality is nothing but pure intelligence. Maitreyi would reply, #E "Just here you have thrown me into confusion, sir - by saying that after attaining the self has no more consciousness"#! His main philosophies were about #Y Metaphysics#! and the doctrine of #Y Neti Neti#!, which means 'Not this, not that,' in order to discover the #Y Atman#!, or soul. This is also why #E Charvaka#! is sometimes considered an agnostic faith."

 omen_ajita:0 "Ajita Kesakambali"
 omen_ajita_desc:0 "Ajita Kesakambali is credited with either the #G founder#! of #E Charvaka#!, or the most important figure of organizing the faith. Regardless, #E Charvaka#! references his work heavily. Ajita is the first known proponent of #Y Indian materialism#!. He was a contemporary of other #E Shramanic#! faith leaders like #E #T Sidharta Gautama#!, #Y Mahavira#!, and #G Mikkhali Goshala#!#!.\n\nIn #E Buddhist#! sources, Ajita wore a blanket of pure hair, being uncomfortable in both heat and cold. It would also be said to smell foul. Furthermore, Ajita is said to mean 'unconquered,' implying he was a fierce and passionate debater. He also is credited with being a champion of #Y Ucchedavada#!, or the doctrine of #R annihilation#! after death."

 omen_payasi:0 "Payasi"
 omen_payasi_desc:0 "Payasi, also called Paesi, was a King of legend. He was said to have run several experiments and concluded that the soul does not exist, a standard doctrine of #Y Materialism#! associated with #E Carvaka#! beliefs. In #E Jain and Buddhist#! myths, he is proven wrong in a debate and #R converts#!, however, this is the views of rival ideologies, and it may be that it is a fabrication in order to claim legitimacy for the other ideologies.\n\nBuddhist lore indicates that Payasi ran several cruel and unusual experiments to determine that the soul does not exist. Amongst these stories, one states how he boiled a thief alive in a bronze jar, and asked how the soul could possibly escape from such a death."

 deity_charvaka:0 "$omen_charvaka$"
 omen_charvaka:0 "Charvaka"
 omen_charvaka_desc:0 "The semi-mythical figure of Charvaka was a person, perhaps responsible for #G founding#! the faith. Of course, several other figures in #E Carvaka#! lore also claim this title, however, Charvaka himself is where the name #E Carvaka#! comes from. If he existed, it is likely from before the 8th century BCE, before the earliest of #Y Materialistic#! views would form."

 deity_pratyaksa:0 "$omen_pratyaksa$"
 omen_pratyaksa:0 "Pratyaksa"
 omen_pratyaksa_desc:0 "#Y Pratyaksa#! is the concept of perception. To Lokayatas, it was the one and only valid way to knowledge and other means of knowledge were either always #R conditional or invalid#!. Most other schools of Indian beliefs had anywhere from two to six different ways of knowledge by comparison. Perceptions are of two types, #E external and internal#!. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind."
