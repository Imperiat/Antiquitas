 omen_masto:0 "Masto"
 omen_masto_desc:0 "The titular god of the pantheon, Masto is the god above all other gods. It is he who is venerated by the Dardic peoples. Masto is a very mysterious god and reliable information on him is scarce. He seems to share some kind of connection with the Indo-Iranic deity Ahura Masta. Masto is said to have 12 brothers and 9 sisters. The brothers are referred to as Masto gods, and the sisters and Durga Goddesses. It is difficult to seperate Masto from traditional Vedic beliefs, as there was a high degree of syncretism, however, Masto was not considerred a part of Vedic belief until the 7th century CE, and was notably distinct before then."

 omen_durga_masto:0 "Nau Duraga Deviyaan"
 omen_durga_masto_desc:0 "The nine Duraga (Durga) sisters of Masto, or the Nau Duraga Deviyaan, are an important force in the Mastoic faith. The Duraga sisters represent an important factor in the main mythological war that occurred between the gods and devils. Masto was fighting the devils but they targeted the Duraga goddesses, believing they were the cause of the fighting. Masto overpowers the devils and finds his sisters. These goddesses would be a point of connection to Vedic Hinduism eventually, possibly even the name 'Duraga' comes from Vedic beliefs, not original Masto beliefs. What does seem certain is that Masto had these 9 sisters, and their names, although varied by region, are something as follows:\n\n1. Malika\n2. Tripurasundari\n3. Khesmalini\n4. Pungelini\n5. Kanaka Sundari\n6. Jalapa\n7. Thingyalni\n8. Himalini\n9. Bindhyabasini."
