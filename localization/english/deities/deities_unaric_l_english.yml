 deity_hinukan:0 "$omen_hinukan$"
 omen_hinukan:0 "Hinukan"
 omen_hinukan_desc:0 "The god of the hearth, Hinukan is related to his contemporary in the lands of the Epi-Jomon, Kamuy-Fuchi. Hinukan is still an important god, however, he is not nearly as central to Unaric as Fuchi is to Fuchite.\n\nHe is usually represented by three small stones within the kitchen. The family-fire god is known to be sacred, especially to the Kaminchuu priestesses. Despite this, he does not consider his home the same as the hearth, but rather likes to go to his home in the heavens for New Years celebrations."

 deity_amamichuu:0 "$omen_amamichuu$"
 omen_amamichuu:0 "Amamichuu"
 omen_amamichuu_desc:0 "The principal deity in the Duuchuu creation myth, Amamichuu was said to be sent by the Heavenly Emporer in his Heavenly Gusuku. He saw the world had no islands, so Amamichuu was sent to create them. Shinerichuu would help her, bringing materials for the islands. Amamichuu saw fit to populate the islands with people, but lacked materials to do so. Shinerichuu would once again help her, impregnating her with the winds, and without sexual intercourse. She would give birth to the first generation of Duuchuu."

 deity_fuuru:0 "$omen_furuu$"
 omen_fuuru:0 "Furugan"
 omen_fuuru_desc:0 "Fuurugan, otherwise called Fuuru nu Kang, is the god of the bathroom. Specifically, he is expected to keep the bathroom clean and safe. May his unending supremacy of toilets never end, for one may finally be at peace, knowing he is safe within the confines of his bathroom. If it were not for Furugan, the evil spirits would take over his habitat and curse those making use of his domain."

 deity_nuuru:0 "$omen_nuuru$"
 omen_nuuru:0 "Nuuru"
 omen_nuuru_desc:0 "Nuuru, also spelled Noro, are the community-wide priestess class within Unaric beliefs. The Nuuru were able to channel the most powerful deities, offering protection to the men. They are considered the oldest and most important of the Kaminchu, or people of divine power.\n\nThe Nuuru are one of the most important and prominent features of Unaric beliefs. The focus on the Nuuru class, in fact, seems to imply a sort of matriarchal religious society. It's difficult to say if this is truly the case, nonetheless, the importance of women in the upper echelon of religious classes is very notable and distinct from other religious traditions in the area."

 deity_yuta:0 "$omen_yuta$"
 omen_yuta:0 "Yuta"
 omen_yuta_desc:0 "The second most prominent class of the people of divine power, or the Kaminchu, are the Yuta. The Yuta were a nearly exclusively female class of shamans and spirit-mediums, able to see, hear, and sometimes even converse with the dead and certain spirits. Like with the Nuuru, the Yuta are chosen by the gods themselves.\n\nThe Yuta acted as a class below the Nuuru, but often were able to undermind the Nuuru. The Yuta were either familially based, or acted in the favor of paying clients. In a way, they served as a mercantile or noble subclass within the priestess class, although that is merely conjecture."

 deity_bunagaya:0 "$omen_bunagaya$"
 omen_bunagaya:0 "Bunagaya"
 omen_bunagaya_desc:0 "The Bunagaya are more commonly known nowadays as the Kijimunaa. Effectively sprites, or even trolls, the Bunagaya are said to live atop Banyan trees (also called Gajumaru in the native Okinawan language). They often play harmless pranks on adults, only being visible to children or those of a pure heart. Their mortal enemies are octopi, the sole thing they fear. Ironically, they encounter them more than the average person because of their affinity for catching and eating fish. Ominously enough, the Bunagaya are often seen with fire, however, this is neither always the case nor does it mean they are purely spirits of evil. They can help people too if they choose to. Overall, they are defined by their toddler like mischevious behavior."

 deity_shimuchi:0 "$omen_shimuchi$"
 omen_shimuchi:0 "Shimuchi"
 omen_shimuchi_desc:0 "The Shimuchi are a more minor class of fortune-tellers. Their name roughly translates to 'book-people,' indicating they were an educated class. Like the Yuta, Shimuchi would keep a suumun, a special box of fortune-telling guides. They often spend their times looking at charts and interpreting signs."

 deity_mabui:0 "$omen_mabui$"
 omen_mabui:0 "Mabui"
 omen_mabui_desc:0 "The Mabui is a concept that resembles a mixture of the soul and mana. This 'mana' is immortal, however it must be treated with respect and taken care of. The Mabui can leave the body, often being disastrous for the host. It can be lost in times of depression, terror, shock, or any kind of extreme suffering. A Mabui-gumi must be performed if a Mabui is lost, and to stave off the losing of a Mabui, a Uchatou-Mintou must be performed instead. Mabui is also transferable. A momento or family heirloom, for example, has a piece of the ancestor's Mabui imbued within them."

 deity_ting:0 "$omen_ting$"
 omen_ting:0 "Ting nu Kang"
 omen_ting_desc:0 "The Ting nu Kang are the heavenly gods, or the gods of heaven. They live in the Heavenly Gusuku, far away from mortals or humanity. The Ting nu Kang are considered by many as some of the most important gods within the entirety of the Unaric faith."

 deity_ukuri:0 "$omen_ukuri$"
 omen_ukuri:0 "Ukuri"
 omen_ukuri_desc:0 "The Ukuri were a class of divinely attuned people similar to the Kaminchu. They operated on the local level. Unlike the Yuta, who also operated on a more individualistic level, the Ukuri were specifically used in familial situations only. The Ukuri were also, unlike the Yuta or Nuuru, not selected by the gods themselves, thus, a lower class religious occupation."

 deity_shinerichuu:0 "$omen_shinerichuu$"
 omen_shinerichuu:0 "Shinerichuu"
 omen_shinerichuu_desc:0 "Shinerichuu was the integral male component to the Duuchuu creation myth. While Amamichuu was the spotlight, Shinerichuu would provide everything Amamichuu needed. He would also help her give birth to the first Duuchuu, however, it is explicitly mentioned that he did not do this via sex as one may first assume. Rather, he impregnated her with divine winds. This creation myth differs heavily from more patriarchal societies, and grants creadance to the idea that the Duuchuu lived in a matriarchal society, at least spiritually and religiously."

 deity_usagiyaa:0 "$omen_usagiyaa$"
 omen_usagiyaa:0 "Usagiyaa"
 omen_usagiyaa_desc:0 "The Usagiyaa were a class of divinely oriented people, however, unlike other such religious classes, the Usagiyaa had no true link to the divine. They still play a very important role in the religious society. This is the treatment of the mystical ailment 'Kami-Daari.' Kami-Daari is a sign that a Yuta woman is receving their calling. However, in the short term, this means ailments as minor as a loss of appetite, and as major as vomitting blood. She is to meet with either an Usagiyaa, or higher classes of spiritual people, to confirm if she is truly experiencing Kami-Daari. Once confirmed, the woman will begin her ascent to becoming a Yuta. If she never meets with an Usagiyaa or equivalent, however, both she and her family will be plagued with curses until she goes mad."

 deity_ikiryo:0 "$omen_ikiryo$"
 omen_ikiryo:0 "Ikiryo"
 omen_ikiryo_desc:0 "The Duuchuu were adamant believers in the negative-spirits, which roughly means ghosts. Ghosts can be many things, notably, Mabui-Utushi; Mabui-Utushi roughly means lost soul. Ikiryo are commonly understood to be 'living ghosts,' causing frights and terrors, typically requiring the use of a #E Yuta#! to expel."
