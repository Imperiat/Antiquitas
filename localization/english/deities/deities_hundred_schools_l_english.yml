Legend has it that he could effortlessly bear the weight of two heavenly mountains while moving at meteoric speeds. With a single somersault, he could traverse over 30,000 miles, and his memory was unparalleled, retaining the names of every monkey ever born. /nSun Wukong’s fame extended far and wide due to his incredible journey to the west. In this epic odyssey, he embarked on a quest to obtain sacred scriptures, joined by his loyal companions, including the mischievous Pigsy and the monk Tripitaka. This journey, chronicled in the literary classic#E Journey to the West#!, is a testament to Sun Wukong's indomitable spirit and his transformation from a rebellious deity to a devoted guardian. \nThe origins of Sun Wukong have sparked numerous theories, with some of the earliest ones tracing back to the Chu Kingdom in 8th-century CE China. This era was rich in legends and myths featuring monkeys and gibbons, and these tales melded with local Taoist beliefs to shape an early rendition of the iconic Monkey King. It's also conceivable that Sun Wukong's legend predates this period, possibly emerging from the lore of other monkey deities found in the Fuzhou province, situated west of Taiwan.

This last point is often a sticking point for the rival school of Ruism, who believe that a son should love their father more than a son should love a stranger. It's important to note that 'Ai' (love) in Mohism was conditional whilst in Ruism it was unconditional."

 omen_huizi_desc:0 "#Y School of Names#! \nHui Shi was best known for his philosophical stance on language and the relativity of truth. His major teaching revolved around the concept of “perspectivism.” Hui Shi proposed that all statements were valid within their own perspective, challenging the notion of absolute truth. This perspective-centric philosophy encouraged a deep examination of language and how it shapes our understanding of reality. His emphasis on linguistic relativity prompted profound discussions among scholars and laid the groundwork for later philosophical inquiries. \n\nOne of the most memorable episodes in Hui Shi's life was his spirited debate with the renowned Daoist philosopher #E Zhuangzi#! about the nature of reality and perception. Zhuangzi questioned the validity of Hui Shi’s perspective, using the example of a fish. He argued that if a fish’s perspective is limited to its watery environment, it would have no concept of what lies beyond the water. Hui Shi's response to this debate, often referred to as the “Butterfly Dream,” highlighted his philosophical position that perspectives shape our understanding of reality and thus that all perspectives have validity.
