 omen_xunzi_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nXunzi's teachings were fundamentally centered on human nature and ethical cultivation. His philosophy challenged the notion of inherent human goodness, asserting instead that individuals are shaped by education and moral discipline. At the core of his beliefs lay the conviction that people must actively cultivate virtue, emphasizing the importance of rituals and traditions as a means to foster ethical behavior.\n\nXunzi played a pivotal role in revitalizing Confucianism during a period when it faced challenges from other philosophical schools. His systematic approach to Confucian thought helped solidify its place as a prominent ideology in Chinese society. His writings, particularly the work to which he lent his name,#E The Xunzi#!, provided a comprehensive framework for understanding and practicing Confucian values, emphasizing the importance of a well-ordered society governed by strict moral principles."

 omen_yanhui_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nThe favorite disciple of Confucius himself, Yan Hui, is one of the most revered figures in Confucianism. His teachings and unwavering dedication to the principles of Confucian thought have left an indelible mark on the tradition. Eventually, during the Han Dynasty period, Yan Hui was venerated along the same lines as Confucius.\n\nYan Hui's life was tragically brief, as he passed away at a mere 29 years of age. It is believed that he might have been one of the earliest recorded cases of progeria, a condition characterized by rapid aging. Confucius was said to have shown 'excessive' grief upon the loss of his favorite disciple. He went so far as to declare that no other student could ever take the place left vacant by Yan's demise, recognizing Yan as the most dedicated and wisest among all his disciples."

 omen_mencius:0 "Mencius"
 omen_mencius_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nMencius, also called Mengzi, was one of the most influential Confucianists after Confucius himself. His teachings center on a profound belief in the innate goodness of human nature, a concept that sets him apart within the Confucian tradition. Mencius passionately advocated for the welfare of the common citizens within a state, emphasizing their significance as the heart of a prosperous society.\n\nOne of Mencius's groundbreaking ideas was the assertion that it is justifiable for subjects to rise against their rulers if those rulers neglect the needs and well-being of the people. This stance represents a significant departure from conventional Confucian thought, which often leans toward supporting the ruling class. Mencius did not undermine the importance of rulers and kings but, in a unique way, recognized the vital role of peasants and freemen in the stability and prosperity of a state."

 omen_confucius:0 "Confucius"
 omen_confucius_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nThe most famous of all Confucian philosophers and, of course, the name from which we derive 'Confucianism,' Confucius is one of the greatest men to come from the history of Chinese civilization. His school of Ruism would go on to remain relevant for centuries to come. Despite all this, Confucius himself never considered himself anything but a transmitter of earlier beliefs. However, it's clear his influence on the school of Ruism would be equal to none, and his disciples would follow in his footsteps in firmly establishing Confucianism in Chinese society.\n\nConfucius's core teachings revolved around the cultivation of moral virtue, ethical governance, and the pursuit of the 'Junzi' or on becoming a noble soul. His emphasis on filial piety, respect for tradition, and the importance of ritual and propriety served as foundational principles of Confucian thought. Through his devoted disciples, Confucius's influence extended far beyond his lifetime, cementing Confucianism as a dominant philosophical and ethical tradition in Chinese society."

 omen_zisi:0 "Zisi"
 omen_zisi_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nZisi, the grandson of Confucius, played a pivotal role in transmitting the profound teachings of Confucius and the Ruist school to the influential philosopher Mencius. His philosophical contributions delved into the realms of meditation and the humbling recognition of humanity's limited knowledge in the vast expanse of the universe. In contrast to his grandfather's emphasis on distinguishing between true and supposed knowledge, Zisi illuminated the value of introspection and the pursuit of wisdom through inner reflection.\n\nZisi's teachings underscored the significance of inner contemplation as a means to cultivate moral virtue and spiritual growth. He advocated for a deeper understanding of the self, recognizing that true wisdom arises from acknowledging the limits of human knowledge in the grand cosmic scheme. This perspective offered a unique dimension to the Confucian tradition, enriching it with a profound sense of humility and reverence for the mysteries of existence. As a bridge between Confucius and Mencius, Zisi's legacy endures as a testament to the evolution of Confucian thought, blending the wisdom of the past with the innovative insights that continue to shape ethical philosophy in China and beyond."

Born as the son of a concubine in the court of Wei, Shang Yang chose to leave his position in Wei to lend his expertise and support to the state of Qin. His pivotal role in aiding Qin during its attack on Wei earned him considerable recognition, including a reward of fifteen cities as a token of appreciation for his contributions to the war effort.\n\nShang Yang's enduring legacy lies in his association with the legalist school of thought, where he is regarded as one of its most prominent proponents, alongside the likes of Han Fei, who was inspired by the work of Shang Yang. Shang Yang's influence extended beyond theory, as he implemented numerous reforms that played a crucial role in the rise of the Qin state.

 omen_sun_wukong_desc:0 "#Y Chinese God#! \nSun Wukong, also known as Sun Wu Kong or Son Goku in Japanese, is among the most renowned figures in Chinese culture. He was worshipped across Eastern Asia as the celebrated Monkey King, a deity associated with agility, strength, and wit. Legend has it that he could effortlessly bear the weight of two heavenly mountains while moving at meteoric speeds. With a single somersault, he could traverse over 30,000 miles, and his memory was unparalleled, retaining the names of every monkey ever born.\n\nSun Wukong's fame extended far and wide due to his incredible journey to the west. In this epic odyssey, he embarked on a quest to obtain sacred scriptures, joined by his loyal companions, including the mischievous Pigsy and the monk Tripitaka. This journey, chronicled in the literary classic #E Journey to the West#!, is a testament to Sun Wukong's indomitable spirit and his transformation from a rebellious deity to a devoted guardian.\n\nThe origins of Sun Wukong have sparked numerous theories, with some of the earliest ones tracing back to the Chu Kingdom in 8th-century CE China. This era was rich in legends and myths featuring monkeys and gibbons, and these tales melded with local Taoist beliefs to shape an early rendition of the iconic Monkey King. It's also conceivable that Sun Wukong's legend predates this period, possibly emerging from the lore of other monkey deities found in the Fuzhou province, situated west of Taiwan. Throughout history, Sun Wukong has been depicted as both a Taoist and Buddhist figure, embodying the spiritual traditions of the region."

Central to his philosophy was the idea that individuals should seek to attain a state of natural spontaneity, transcending rigid social conventions and desires.\n\nZhuangzi often employed allegorical tales and anecdotes to illustrate his philosophical concepts, emphasizing the relativity of human perspectives and the illusory nature of distinctions between right and wrong. His contributions to Taoism are of paramount importance. Zhuangzi's writings, particularly#E The Zhuangzi#!, are considered foundational texts within Taoist thought. They explore themes of freedom, the relativity of truth, and the importance of embracing change as essential elements of the Taoist path. Zhuangzi's emphasis on the relativity of human perspectives and the illusory nature of distinctions between right and wrong deeply influenced the development of Taoist philosophy and its practical applications in areas such as meditation, martial arts, and holistic living."

Hailing from the state of Zheng, his life remains shrouded in mystery, with sparse historical records due in part to book burnings orchestrated by the Taoists themselves.\n\nSome scholars have entertained the intriguing possibility that Lie Yukou might have been a creation of the legendary Zhuangzi, an exemplar designed to embody the principles of Taoism. Despite the uncertainties surrounding his existence, the 'Liezi' remains a treasured Taoist text, delving into the profound concepts of the Tao, natural spontaneity, and the relativity of human perspectives. It continues to inspire seekers of the Way, contributing to the rich tapestry of Taoist philosophy."

 omen_huangdi_desc:0 "#Y Chinese God#! \nHuangdi, better known to the West as the Yellow Emperor, is a shen representing the center of the universe. He is known as the deity of 'Four Faces,' which speaks to his vision of a unity controlled in four directions. Chinese Taoists of this time often credited Huangdi as the originator of Taoist principles over Laozi. He is an immortal being of Taoism and existed far before Taoism was a school of thought. Huangdi existed as a Shenic god before Chinese Taoists would see him as a Taoist shen instead."

Interestingly, Laozi's name, meaning 'The Old Master,' is an honorific title, while his actual name is a subject of ongoing debate, with possibilities including Er or Dan. Regardless of who he really was, Laozi's legacy endures through the timeless wisdom found in the Tao Te Ching, helping adherents understand the tenets of Taoism and the path to harmonious living until the modern day."

Mozi famously preached Universal Love, or Jian Ai, which is a form of utilitarianism. Mohists were known for their technical and military prowess despite being against offensive wars. Famously, Mozi would convince the Chu Kingdom not to attack the Song Kingdom despite having superior numbers. He did this by convincing the Chu that the Song, which was filled with Mohists, had the ability beyond anyone else to dismantle the advanced siege weaponry of the Chu. No matter how many mock battles they did, Mozi would always win against the general Gongshu. Ultimately, the Chu Kingdom would not war on Song, seeing little to gain but much to lose."

He was considered the founder of the debatably mythically Xia Dynasty. He predates Mozi and his school of Mo by a thousand years, yet, some branches of Mohism believe that Yu the Great was an exemplar of Mohist doctrine and that Mohists should seek to emulate Yu. In fact, many Mohists believed it was their duty to follow in Yu the Great's altruism.\n\nIt is said that Mozi turned his back to the former Zhou dynasty.

 omen_universal_love_desc:0 "#Y School of Mo#!\nThe doctrine of Jian Ai is the most famous of all of the doctrines of the School of Mo. Directly translated, it means Impartial Care, or, Universal Love. This is a utalitarian way of thinking that beckons that one should always love others in the same way they love themselves, regardless of familial relation. This last point is often a sticking point for the rival school of Ruism, who believe that a son should love their father more than a son should love a stranger. It's important to note that 'Ai' (love) in Mohism was conditional whilst in Ruism it was unconditional."

Through expert diplomacy, Yue Yi orchestrated alliances with various states, including Wei, Chu, Han, Zhao, and Qin, uniting their forces to cripple the ascendant Qi. His leadership on the battlefield proved instrumental as he masterminded the downfall of Qi, leading to the exile of its ruthless king and nearly bringing the entire Qi territory under control.\n\nYue Yi was personally granted control over the region of Chang by his benefactor, King Zhao, but things rapidly changed following the sudden demise of King Zhao, leaving the state in chaos and Yue Yi without a patron. The Qi exploited this moment of weakness and recovered part of their lost territory, causing Yue Yi to flee to Zhao, fearing that the new King of Yan, Hui would lead the forces of Yan to total ruin. This soon came to pass, the Qi decimating the armies of the overconfident Yan. King Hui eventually managed to win Yue Yi over and was entrusted with sweeping powers.

His major teaching revolved around the concept of “perspectivism.” Hui Shi proposed that all statements were valid from their own perspective, challenging the notion of absolute truth. This perspective-centric philosophy encouraged a deep examination of language and how it shapes our understanding of reality. His emphasis on linguistic relativity prompted profound discussions among scholars and laid the groundwork for later philosophical inquiries.\n\nOne of the most memorable episodes in Hui Shi's life was his spirited debate with the renowned Daoist philosopher #E Zhuangzi#! about the nature of reality and perception. Zhuangzi questioned the validity of Hui Shi's perspective, using the example of a fish. He argued that if a fish’s perspective is limited to its watery environment, it would have no concept of what lies beyond the water. Hui Shi's response to this debate, often referred to as the “Butterfly Dream,” highlighted his philosophical position that perspectives shape our understanding of reality and thus that all perspectives have validity.
