 thracian_path_11:0 "Trained Cavalry"

 thracian_path_13_desc:0 "Many of our warriors do not even fight with shields, preferring instead to focus all their energy on relentlessly attacking the enemy."

 bactrian_path_13:0 "Sogdian Rock"
 bactrian_path_13_desc:0 "News had come in that a large number of the natives had taken refuge on the Rock of Sogdia, among them the wife and daughters of Oxyartes the Bactrian, who had himself refused to submit to Alexander and had chosen this refuge for his family in the belief that it was impregnable. To the Rock, therefore, Alexander advanced. He found that it rose sheer on every side against attack. The natives had provisioned it for a long siege, and deep snow on its summit caused the double disadvantage of making the ascent more awkward for the Macedonians and all but ensuring the defenders an unlimited supply of water. Nevertheless, Alexander was determined on assault. The reason for his determination was the native's offensive bragging, which made him angry. He had called on them to discuss terms, and offered to allow them to return to their homes on condition of surrendering the stronghold, but their answer to the offer was a shout of laughter. Then they told Alexander to bring soldiers with wings to capture the Rock for him, as no other sort of person could cause them the least anxiety. As a result, Alexander proclaimed that he would give twelve talents to the first man up, and eleven to the second, and ten to the third, and so on to the twelfth, who would receive 300 gold darics. Around 300 men who in previous sieges had had experience in rock-climbing now assembled and set off under cover of darkness to the steepest part of the rock-face, which they knew was least likely to be guarded; then, driving their pegs either into bare ground or into such patches of snow as seemed most likely to hold under the strain, they hauled themselves up, wherever each could find a way. About thirty lost their lives during the ascent, but the rest reached the top as dawn was breaking, and the summit of the Rock was theirs. Alexander sent a crier to shout the news to the enemy's advanced posts that they might now surrender, as men with wings had been found and were already in possession of the summit. The unexpectedness of the sight was a severe shock to the natives, who were so alarmed by the handful of Macedonian troops they could actually see, that, imagining a larger force, and fully armed at that, must be in possession, they surrendered."
 bactrian_path_14:0 "Veteran Communities"
 bactrian_path_14_desc:0 "Our veterans teach the younger recruits, their experience mixing with the temperament of youth."
 bactrian_path_15:0 "Silk Road"
 bactrian_path_15_desc:0 "The Silk Road began to be established by the Diadochi, Alexander's successors. In the following centuries, it began to take on a more and more recognizable shape."
