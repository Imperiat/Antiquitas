 form_hunnic_empire_desc: "Defeated and outcast, our people are forced to migrate westward across the steppe in search of a new beginning, fighting off those in our way as we march ever-closer towards the edge of the known world.

With our greatest warriors mounted on horseback, we shall swarm through these undefended cities like a ravenous plague and crush any pathetic attempt at resistance we may encounter. From the ruin of our enemies, we will forge a new empire to dominate the western world."
