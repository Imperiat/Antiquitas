gadiran_heritage_desc:0 "Founded as a major port city in the mid-late 8th century by Tyrian merchants and colonists, Gadir became the greatest trading hub beyond the Pillars of Herakles under the patronage of the god Melqart and his Oracle. Bolstered originally in its power by the large wealth of silver and precious metals mined from the nearby cliffs and mountains, Gadir leads a strong union of former Punic colonies, developing and controlling the Atlantic trade from the Cassiterides in the north to Arambys in the south."
