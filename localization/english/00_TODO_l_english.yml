 flavor_gaul.46.t: "Honor Ancestors"
 flavor_gaul.46.desc: "Although it comes at a premium - one hundred gold coins, to be exact - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has insisted on the proper rites being observed when it involves honoring our ancestors, no matter what the costs might be. While this is one of our oldest religious traditions, in lean years, we have not done as much as we could, but [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has put an end to this aberration.\n\nMoving forward, no more corners will be cut - full sacrificial rites shall be held for our forebears, a sign of the renewed piety that is possessing the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 flavor_gaul.46.a: "It is our duty to honor those who came before us"
 flavor_gaul.47.t: "Preparations for Burial"
 flavor_gaul.47.desc: "As the period of mourning for our previous leader begins, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been privately approached by the Wise Ones and the Elders, who insist that we honor our old ways by giving the deceased a proper [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] Wagon Burial. This is a great honor, reserved only for the most elite in our society, but whether or not we proceed is entirely up to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName].\n\nAlthough it is unpleasant to discuss financial matters when our entire nation is grieving, there are substantial costs associated with wagon burials and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has to sign off on the purchases."
 flavor_gaul.47.a: "Yes, everything shall be prepared according to tradition"
 flavor_gaul.47.b: "We simply cannot afford this right now - there will be no wagon"
 flavor_gaul.48.t: "Burying The Wagon"
 flavor_gaul.48.desc: "There is a somber procession taking place a few hour's ride outside of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] as the final preparations are being made for one of our most ancient traditions; the wagon burial of a cultural elite.\n\nAll manner of grave goods are lowered into the ground - sumptuous dining dishes wrought in silver, torcs of gold and ceremonial fur capes, drinking horns and gem-encrusted banquet trays - as the requisite animals and slaves are sacrificed nearby. Everything has been done to exacting standards, and the omens show that the gods are very pleased by our attention to the finer details.\n\nThere is a respectful silence as the last of the earth falls over the wagon, and one by one, everyone turns towards [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who offers a few words."
 flavor_gaul.48.a: "As we remember our obligations to the dead, may they give us their blessings"
 flavor_gaul.49.t: "Bribe The Council"
 flavor_gaul.49.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a reputation for not allowing anything to get in the way of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] plans being completed; every military matter that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has encountered, for example, has been handled promptly and ruthlessly, with an efficiency that could be mistaken for callousness.\n\nIt should come as no surprise to those paying attention that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] would resort to political bribery in order to move the gears of state. Every bag of silver handed over, every golden torc, was delivered with an unspoken threat to seal the deal."
 flavor_gaul.49.a: "If my enemies won't accept my coins, let them receive my daggers..."
 flavor_gaul.50.t: "Monarchic Ambition"
 flavor_gaul.50.desc: "Although not everyone is happy today - there are those who ridiculously believe themselves to be better candidates for the throne - a momentous occasion is upon us; under the watchful eye of our Elders and the Wise One, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is undergoing ritual purification for the coronation ceremony later on today in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. When the sun sets in a few hours and the sacrifices are complete, we shall have a new form of government.\n\nAlthough our people have never been governed by a true sovereign before, it has been acknowledged that the time is finally here. May the gods continue to grant [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the wisdom and intelligence to carry our nation forward."
 flavor_gaul.50.a: "I shall not let you down, but will do everything for Treveria always!"
 flavor_gaul.51.t: "Triumph in Treveria"
 flavor_gaul.51.desc: "When all is said and done, there is much for our people to be proud of. Not only have we destroyed the inferior tribes that surrounded us, absorbing their strength and power into our own, but we have started to create a civilization that is truly worthy of being respected. We have also raised up a line of Kings to rule over us, and our engineers have tamed the wild woodlands, building cities and magnificent edifices that dazzle the eye with their cleverness.\n\nWhile the people have done much to deserve these honors themselves, many admit that we would not be as far along as we are without [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - even [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s detractors admit that we have been blessed with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] leadership."
 flavor_gaul.51.a: "All hail Treveria!"
 flavor_gaul.52.t: "Treveria"
 flavor_gaul.52.desc: "While [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has certainly serviced our people well, lately, there is a growing chorus demanding that we move our capital to [GetProvince('(int32)3690').GetName]. Not only does the city of Treveria have river access, which is vital for its economic success, but it is also located on the plains, which gives our people room to expand in the future. The forests near Caranusca are proving to be a hindrance to development, as everything costs more.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a decision to make."
 flavor_gaul.52.a: "Let us move our capital - there are no reasons for us to stay at an inferior site"
 flavor_gaul.52.b: "We are not abandoning our ancestral homelands"
 flavor_gaul.53.t: "Treverian Belgium"
 flavor_gaul.53.desc: "Although the civilized nations fear the #E Belgae#! the most when it comes to the tribes of Gaul, in time, they will learn that the bravest and fiercest warriors come from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] levies. For what are the Belgae compared to us? We have destroyed the myth of their superiority and have driven them back into their villages and settlements."
 flavor_gaul.53.a: "I shall lead our armies to victory over all of our enemies!"

 roman_12_mission_task_1_claims_tt:0 ""

 me_roman_missions_inv.10.t: "Illyrian War"
 me_roman_missions_inv.10.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have received grim news this morning - the perfidious #E Illyrians#! have attacked us! Their barbarous hordes are already on the march, vowing to sack any Roman cities they come across - it behooves us to meet them in the field before they have a chance to despoil the countryside.\n\nWe hope that this conflict ends quickly, because the entire region has the potential to ignite if we are not careful."
 me_roman_missions_inv.10.a: "Begun, the Illyrian Wars have..."
 me_roman_missions_inv.11.t: "Triumph Over the Savage Lands"
 me_roman_missions_inv.11.desc: "Although there were those who disagreed with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s decision to send our soldiers into the lands of the [GetProvince('(int32)4053').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName], all are silent in this hour of victory - truly, how could anyone have doubted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who has consistently demonstrated brilliance at every turn?\n\nEven now, the naysayers, their wagging tongues choked by jealousy, watch silently from the sidelines as a triumphal arch is erected in [GetProvince('(int32)1').GetName] - an eternal monument to the wisdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]. All hail the power of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"
 me_roman_missions_inv.11.a: "This region shall make a fine addition to the lands of the Romans"
 me_roman_missions_inv.12.t: "Illyrian Emissaries"
 me_roman_missions_inv.12.desc: "Because the Roman people value friendship and peace over the alternatives, we have decided to send emissaries to the #E Illyrians#!, hoping beyond hope that the barbarians can be shown the error of their ways thus far. If, gods willing, they are willing to rectify their behavior, then perhaps we will avoid hostilities, but that depends on them entirely at this point.\n\nWe don't just give everyone the opportunity to become our #Y Client State#! - they should think long and hard before responding."
 me_roman_missions_inv.12.a: "Tell our men to take as much time as they need and to be generous"
 me_roman_missions_inv.12.b: "This is official business, not a vacation - be professional"
 me_roman_missions_inv.13.t: "Illyrian Emissaries"
 me_roman_missions_inv.13.desc: "Great news from our diplomats! The Illyrians have seen the wisdom in becoming one of our client states and have agreed to submit peacefully. Everything we wanted has happened, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]! We should celebrate tonight."
 me_roman_missions_inv.13.a: "Bring out the best wine! Falernian if we have it!"
 me_roman_missions_inv.14.t: "Illyrian Emissaries"
 me_roman_missions_inv.14.desc: "It shouldn't be too surprising to hear that the Illyrians have rejected our offer, for everyone knows how daft they are. What a calamity they have brought down on the heads of their children and mothers! We pray that war between our nations does not happen, for it will be an unfair pairing - we will obliterate them without remorse."
 me_roman_missions_inv.14.a: "Well, they are barbarians after all...what did we expect?"

 punic_resurgence_12_title: "Infighting Amongst Allies"
 punic_resurgence_12_desc: "Although disagreements between partners is a common enough story, we have heard stories of some of the arguments between our League members becoming a bit too pointed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. It seems that camps are starting to coalesce around a couple of charismatic figures, who are taking the opportunity to give grand orations that denounce each other.\n\nAll of this, as you can imagine, is a distraction to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] business."
 punic_resurgence_12.a: "Pay close attention to the troublemakers"
 punic_resurgence_12.b: "We do not care about this matter at all"
 punic_resurgence_13_title: "State Leaves League"
 punic_resurgence_13_desc: "We have received messengers in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that bring a bit of unfortunate news - our Punic League has lost a member, for whatever ridiculous reason they are citing."
 punic_resurgence_13.a: "We don't need them anyways, but this is annoying nevertheless"
 punic_resurgence_16_title: "An Enemy Force Has Landed!"
 punic_resurgence_16_desc: "Grim news, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - the reports are incomplete, no doubt due to the haste required to inform us, but it seems that an enemy force of indeterminate size has landed on our shores.\n\nBest keep this news from the men, as their morale is suffering as it is."
 punic_resurgence_16.a: "We shall meet their forces in battle and push them back into the sea!"

 me_macedon_1_legacy.132.t: "Treaty of Mylasa"
 me_macedon_1_legacy.132.desc: "The text of what came to be known as the 'Treaty of Mylasa' wasted no words on formal introductions or flowery language, no invocations to the gods asking for blessings of health - a sign of how far relations have deteriorated at this point.\n\nThe only information in the treaty was the simple demarcation of boundaries."

 #LOBBY RECOMMENDED COUNTRY INTROS
 joseon_start:0 "#T Joseon#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nNearly two thousand years ago, the Kingdom of Joseon was established by the semi-mythical leader Dangun, and her people have struggled ever since then to hold on to what they have. In recent years, conflicts with Yan to the west have resulted in Joseon ceding vast tracts of land to her neighbor, and the threat of tribal invasion from the north and east remains present."
 chu_start:0 "#T Chu#!\nDifficulty: #Y Hard#!\n\nAlthough Chu was once a powerful and stable country, the envy of those around her, the last few decades have seen unchecked corruption spreading throughout the government. The people's suffering is compounded by the ineffective and duplicitous leadership that has choked the state, as poor diplomatic decisions have left Chu isolated and paranoid."
 qin_start:0 "#T Qin#!\nDifficulty: #Y Easy#!\n\nAs all of China is consumed by the conflagration of the Warring States Period, the state of Qin is slowly but surely beginning to dominate her neighbors. Strengthened by innovative Legalist Reforms and bolstered by an indomitable martial spirit, Qin stands on the precipice of history."
 yamato_start:0 "#T Yamato#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nFar to the East lies the island of Wa, which is partitioned and divided between the various tribes that live on its shores. Life can be difficult on Wa; the region of Yamato, a small enclave of farmland surrounded by rolling hills, is home to a sturdy and industrious people that are prepared for anything."

 thaton_start:0 "#T Thaton#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nThaton in the Mon tongue of the natives was called as #E Sadhuim#!, which in turn came from the word Sudhammapura, an Indo-Aryan word meaning #E 'Assembly of the Gods.'#! The city-state of Sadhuim was established in at least the 4th century BC and became rich from trade between Sri Lanka. The Kingdom, colloquially called the #E Thaton Kingdom#!, would go on to unite much of the Southern Mons and enter into legend, before being conquered by the #E Kingdom of Pegu#!. In its long legacy from its founding to its ultimate destruction, it left a lasting cultural legacy that remained in the lore of its eventual faith forever."
 qi_start:0 "#T Qi#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAt the beginning of the Warring States period, three great powers stood above all others; Qin, Chu, and Qi. Over the last couple hundred years, Qi has sided with its various neighbors when it was politically convenient to do so, entering conflicts with former allies and managing to build up its holdings, especially around its capital of Linzi."
 phnom_start:0 "#T Phnom#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAt the tip of the Mekong Delta, where the waters of the mighty river empty into the South China Sea, the settled tribes of Phnom make their home. Their homelands are blessed with natural wealth, and foreign merchants often visit their capital city of Vyadhapura for the best prices on these luxury goods."

 ingala_mod:0 "Ingala Valley"
 ingala_mod_desc:0 "The Ingala Valley has supported large populations in this portion of the forest-steppe since at least the Early Bronze Age, and with the expansion of the Sargat culture into the former lands of Gorokhovo, the Sargat have inherited the capital of the Eastern Urals and have used the bountiful resources and wetlands to thrive and project influence throughout Scytho-Siberia."

 rice_terrace_mod:0 "Rice Terraces"
 rice_terrace_mod_desc:0 "For thousands of years, the ancestors of the modern Ifugao people have cultivated the mountains and valleys of the Philippine Cordillera. While the antiquity of the famous terraces is still debated (with some researchers claiming their date back over 2,000 years), there is no doubt that the people here grew rice, taro and other crops since Austronesians arrived about 4,000 years ago. The ability to produce crops at such high altitudes and marginal environments through masterful agro-engineering skills ensures food stability and abundance in the region."

 chinese_tiger_mod:0 "Chinese Tigers"
 chinese_tiger_mod_desc:0 "The Chinese Tiger is among the most iconic beasts to roam the wilds of the world, striking awe and fear into those who come across it. Tigers feature heavily in Chinese religious and cultural beliefs, while Chinese Tiger skins and bones have been prized trade goods since time immemorial. Pet tigers were also revered in the courts of China and the southern tribes, being traded live as cubs to the royalty and nobility of Asia."

 white_tiger_mod:0 "White Tigers"
 white_tiger_mod_desc:0 "The spectacular White Bengal Tigers of central India, found especially from the area around Ambaloda, are a rare and beautiful specimen. The animal sells for staggering amounts of gold to all the kings and nobility of India, both alive and or dead. These rare white tigers are a variation of the orange Bengal Tiger, with the white color deriving from a recessive gene."

 ebony_mod:0 "Forests of Ebony"
 ebony_mod_desc:0 "Since the times of the early pharaohs of Egypt, ebony wood has been a treasured trade item from vast forests of the Sudan and Aethiopeia. This precious dark black hard wood was valued as jewelry, for making furniture and other ornaments. The ancient Egyptians also used the hard black wood to inscribe heiroglyphs, some dating to over five thousands years ago."

 xishi_mod:0 "Temple of the Beauty Xi Shi"
 xishi_mod_desc:0 "The legendary Xi Shi, the first beauty of China, was born in Zhuji and lived in the early 5th century BC. Xi Shi's beauty was said to be so extreme that while leaning over a balcony to look at the fish in the pond, the fish would be so dazzled that they forgot to swim and sank below the surface. She was discovered by minister Fan Li of the Yue kingdom and gifted to the rival Wu Kingdom. He became hypnotized by her and built a large temple for her and other beauties. Little did King Fuchai of Wu know that minister Fan Li plotted with the beauty Xi Shi in one of history's first recorded sexpionage operations - Xi Shi successfully seduced the king, convinced him to kill his advisors and greatest general, and ignore state affairs, leading to the downfall of the kingdom shortly thereafter. Xi Shi's stunning beauty has inspired songs and stories for millenia since."
