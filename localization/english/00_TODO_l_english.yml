#LOBBY RECOMMENDED COUNTRY INTROS
joseon_start:0 "#T Joseon#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nNearly two thousand years ago, the Kingdom of Joseon was established by the semi-mythical leader Dangun, and her people have struggled ever since then to hold on to what they have. In recent years, conflicts with Yan to the west have resulted in Joseon ceding vast tracts of land to her neighbor, and the threat of tribal invasion from the north and east remains present."
chu_start:0 "#T Chu#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAlthough Chu was once a powerful and stable country, the envy of those around her, the last few decades have seen unchecked corruption spreading throughout the government. The people's suffering is compounded by the ineffective and duplicitous leadership that has choked the state, as poor diplomatic decisions have left Chu isolated and paranoid."
qin_start:0 "#T Qin#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAs all of China is consumed by the conflagration of the Warring States Period, the state of Qin is slowly but surely beginning to dominate her neighbors. Strengthened by innovative Legalist Reforms and bolstered by an indomitable martial spirit, Qin stands on the precipice of history."
yamato_start:0 "#T Yamato#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nFar to the East lies the island of Wa, which is partitioned and divided between the various tribes that live on its shores. Life can be difficult on Wa; the region of Yamato, a small enclave of farmland surrounded by rolling hills, is home to a sturdy and industrious people that are prepared for anything."

 ##ACB RELIGIONS
 chinese_religions:0 "Chinese"
 desc_chinese_religions:0 "A land that is as vast as China is contains many philosophies and traditions that are interwoven to create a rich tapestry of spiritual life; the precepts of the great teachers, such as Kong Fuzi, are respected and upheld alongside the ancient ritual practices of the local clans. Ancestors are venerated, and sacred gifts are offered to the capricious guardian spirits that protect the hearth."
 hu_religions:0 "Hu"
 desc_hu_religions:0 "Life on the Great Steppes can be harsh, and the religion of its peoples is focused on the practicalities of everyday life, eschewing metaphysical mysteries for the realities that can be seen and observed; the Sun, Moon, Heaven, and our honorable Ancestors are worthy of veneration."
 baiyue_religions:0 "Baiyue"
 desc_baiyue_religions:0 "The religious teachings of the Baiyue reveal that everything in the world around us, from the mighty streams that flow from the mountains into the marshes to the rocks and stones that comprise the riverbank, has a soul and is worthy of worship, so that the universe might remain in a harmonious state."
 yi_religions:0 "Yi"
 desc_yi_religions:0 "The religious practices of the Yi are similar to those around them, yet there are distinctive markers that distinguish the tenets of the Yi from those of their neighbors. The veneration of dragons, who alone have the authority to ensure the harvests and protect our villages from illness and misfortune, is supremely important."
 wa_religions:0 "Wa"
 desc_wa_religions:0 "The spirits worshiped by the Wa are a direct reflection of the violent world they inhabit; ruled by an Animist pantheon of squabbling demons and gods that can only have their thirst quenched by the blood of worthy sacrifices, the Wa remember the ancient ways amd uphold them faithfully."

#AOS GOVERNMENTS
chinese_empire:0 "Chinese Empire"
chinese_empire_desc:0 "As shown by the reigns of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, in which the divine authority of the Emperor was demonstrated for all under Heaven to see, the Imperial Form of government remains the supreme achievement of political life, all but ensuring peace and prosperity for conscientious stewards of the Mandate of Heaven."

enfeoffment_zhourites:0 "Enfeoffment Zhourites"
enfeoffment_zhourites_desc:0 "The system of governance created by our predecessors in the Shang Dynasty remains a viable way of ruling the people to this very day. By creating a vast, decentralized bureaucratic state, in which lands and authority are meted out to powerful vassals in return for oaths of submission, true peace can be secured."

chinese_duhufu:0 "Duhufu"
chinese_duhufu_desc:0 "In order to properly adminster the hinterlands, special types of administrative districts known as 'Duhufu' are established as ways to entrench the Imperial power in the lands that are distant from our capital. The governor of a Duhufu has unquestioned military and economic authority, carrying out the commands of their superiors with one voice."

#ACB HERITAGES (TI HERITAGES)

qin_heritage:0 "Qin Heritage"
qin_heritage_desc:0 "The Qin excel at organization, with an affinity for reform that has quickly propelled these people to lofty heights involving military and legal matters.

### Southeast Asian TI Heritages
# Pegu
pegu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sea Pyu"
pegu_heritage_desc:0 "Downstream from Sri Ksetra, there is a legend of a place called 'Pinle Pyu' which was adjacent to the sea. Large in size, the settlements around the seaside contain records of Brahmi script. It is still uncertain whether this site was the upstream location of Ingapu or somewhere more southern, perhaps closer to the settlement of Pegu which was a Mon-culture stronghold. Artifacts from the area date to the Paleolithic period at the earliest."
# Thaton
thaton_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Theravadan Hall of the Gods"
thaton_heritage_desc:0 "While the stories claim that Thaton was a product of the age of the Buddha, built during the life of the holy man, it is more firmly understood that the kingdom of Thaton existed from at least the 4th century BCE. Trading heavily with India and Sri Lanka, many Buddhist people flocked here and set up the foundation for the Theravada school of Buddhism. Much of this can be attributed to the work of Moggaliputta-Tissa, the monk responsible for many overseas missions. Thaton thus, in stories, derived its name from Suvarnabhumi, meaning 'assembly of the gods.' Thus this holy place served as a basis for continuous Buddhist spread thereafter."
# Yilumo
yilumo_heritage:0 "Heritage of Yilumo"
yilumo_heritage_desc:0 "One of the city-states the Chinese would pass or stop at on their way to Indian markets, Yilumo was one of the early Mon settlements on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. While the northern Indian territories promised Chinese merchants pearls and opaque glass, coastal sites such as Yilumo provided some of the harder trade goods, like raw lumber and other natural necessities that assisted in facilitating the trade route."
# Tenasserim
tenasserim_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sea Gypsies"
tenasserim_heritage_desc:0 "The archipelago which surrounds the coast of the Tenasserim region is home to a vast array of life, from whales and Irrawaddy dolphins to whale sharks and dugongs. Such a wildlife diversity in the bay and among the mangrove forests which cross the waters allowed for the people to lean heavily on a fishing lifestyle. However, the islands also lent themselves to Chinese and other merchants and sailors as hideouts and alternative pathways to the open waters which were subject to monsoons and other dangers. The coast thus brought riches to the coastal settlements which had their own goods to trade as well. Ancient Tavoy was loaded with tungsten, tin, and other useful metals that could be traded to more centralized city-building civilizations."
# Khao Sam Kaeo
khao_sam_kaeo_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Port of Ideas"
khao_sam_kaeo_heritage_desc:0 "An important gateway in the Maritime Silk Road, the site of Khao Sam Kaeo came to be by at least the 4th century BCE. Chinese, Philippine, Taiwanese, and other types of goods crossed through their waters and territory in order to access the Indian markets to the west. However, many craftsmen and traders also stayed in the port-city and turned it into a bustling hub of knowledge and production, much more than just a waystation. The silks that were exchanged in its markets appeared as often as new peoples and ideas, leading to a great mixture of technological influences and progress. The local material culture shows such a mixture of peoples in its many unique art styles and products such as stone adzes and jewelry."
# Khuan Lukpad
khuan_lukpad_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Malay Processing Center"
khuan_lukpad_heritage_desc:0 "This site served as a trading post which imported and Indian raw materials and produced finished goods for eastern markets - such is known from their many ring molds (likely meant to be used with gold) and seal molds. From India, they also received goods as far aways as Middle Eastern markets of Persia. Brahmi inscriptions and some Tamil artifacts indicate a possibility of Indian craftsmen also setting up shop in the port in order to be closer to Chinese and other eastern merchants on their way around the Malay peninsula."
# Panpan
panpan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Red Earth Land"
panpan_heritage_desc:0 "While not a major hub in the region, the kingdom of Panpan succeeded in growing a lively trading economy that interacted with the Chinese and other East Asian markets to its north. Strangely enough, their contact with Indian markets to the west actually led to a significant and growing Hindu population which colored the daily life of an otherwise Austronesian populace, influencing local wares and practices in the area. They were known by Chinese sources possibly as the 'Red Earth Land,' perhaps on account of their local soil/clay/pottery or other goods with a penchant for red coloration."
# Kedah
kedah_heritage:0 "Heritage of Ancient Ocean-Lords"
kedah_heritage_desc:0 "Established in the early 8th century BCE, the kingdom of Kedah and the settlement of Sungai Batu were older than Rome itself and were set up for major success in naval trade from the beginning. Iron was accessible, and their position in the Malay peninsula, both close to the Strait of Malacca and on the same latitude line as Ceylon (Sri Lanka) allowed ships to most easily sail directly to and access Ceylon and South Indian markets by leaving from their port as opposed to any others. However, they were not simply a trading station for others to pass through, and built their own fleet of Austronesian/Malay ships to bring their native goods westward. Reports tell of them having light vessels for local transportation and traffic, larger vessels for major transfers of goods, and great ocean-going vessels which took their own sailors directly to Indian, Sumatran, and Bangli ports and markets. They held a powerful command over the ocean and the ability to sail it."
# Langkashuka
langkashuka_heritage:0 "Heritage of Merong the 'Alexandrian'"
langkashuka_heritage_desc:0 "One of the older successful seaports on the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula), the Kingdom of Langkashuka and the settlement of Pattani were only a bit younger than Old Kedah. It was supposedly founded by a king named Merong Mahawangsa, who supposedly traveled and learned from many great Empires both east and west, and even fought a great phoenix called the Garuda on his naval travels. Some stories claim he was a descendant or relative of Alexander the Great, but most of all his tales and aspects bleed of legend and superstition. What the reality of this founder may, however, betray, was the reality that many Indian travelers, traders, and Buddhist missionaries arrived at the port of Pattani and became integral components of the kingdom, altering its populace’s identity and faith."
# Kelantan
kelantan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Malaysian Ghosts"
kelantan_heritage_desc:0 "The history and foundation of Kelantan are shrouded in myth - the land is said to have once been walked by giants (To' Gedambai), with a great Naga coming onto the shore with the push of a flood. A Tiger roamed the forest, the Hantu Belian, stalking its prey, and the aboriginals (To' Bomor), hid in the crevices, tiny black youths which some consider to have been the ghosts of the dead. Other tales claim the city was founded by a queen of the Sakai named Gunong Ayam. With a largely agrarian economy/society and some of the largest mountains in the Malay peninsula to separate it from other areas, the land of Kelantan is full of mystery and secrets."
# Gangga Negara
gangga_negara_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Far Ganges"
gangga_negara_heritage_desc:0 "Gangga Negara, meaning 'city on the Ganges,' takes its name from the Northwestern Indian Kambuja traders and merchants that settled the area along with many others in the Malay peninsula. In contrast, the settlement of Beruas takes its name from the local Beruas tree and fruit. Some stories tell how the kingdom was founded by Raja Ganji Sarjuna of Old Kedah, a nearby neighboring and older kingdom. Like other traveling kings, this man was supposedly a descendant of Alexander the Great. The Indian settlement, however, did introduce Hinduism to the Malay natives to create a vibrant cultural and religious mixture when considering their art and cult sites."
# Selangor
selangor_heritage:0 "Heritage of a Bronze Klang"
selangor_heritage_desc:0 "With its most important city of Klang having been inhabited since the early Bronze Age, the territory of Selangor has long been a player in Malaysian geo-politics. The city of Klang itself fueled the power of Selangor with a tin-rich valley and the ability to make quality bronzes. Their metalworkers could fashion such wonderful objects as the Klang-type bell, iron tools called 'ape-bones,' and bronze drums meant either for war or ritual festivities. Connected by tich waterways to the sea, it could transport these metal luxuries and necessities to trading partners all over."
# Pahang
pahang_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mahang Tree"
pahang_heritage_desc:0 "Taking both its name and border from the Pahang river, which itself supposedly received its name from a legendary mahang tree that stretched across the river with its roots, settlements within the Kingdom of Pahang have existed since the Mesolithic period. Bronze, especially in the form of war-drums, became prominent by 400 BCE, and goldworking became a mainstay in production and trade, helping to give the Malay peninsula its known title of the 'Golden Chersonese.' However, while the area was a cradle of Malay culture and civilization, it often found itself subordinate to Funan-area kingdoms and influenced by those far-off courts."
# Kota Gelanggi
kota_gelanggi_heritage:0 "Heritage of Malaccan Treasures"
kota_gelanggi_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly known to Mediterranean cultures as Sabana/Sabara, or the port of Nominon Emporium, Kota Gelanggi and the modern-Singapore area were a pivotal point in the Maritime Silk Road, controlling the Strait of Malacca. The settlement of Kota Gelanggi itself was quite rich in its surrounding natural resources and the profits of its trade - a fort or palace made all out of black stone and a name derived from something akin to 'Treasury of Jewels.' It is no surprise that this was therefore a wealthy and prosperous site, gaining the awe and jealousy of its neighbors."
# Shenli
shenli_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Golden Buddhist Cradle"
shenli_heritage_desc:0 "The origin place of Dvaravati culture, U Thong city and the Shenli territories were rich in natural resources, with U Thong being known as a city of gold, or the “Golden Cradle.” However, it was a city lost in dichotomy - legends tell of its founding by a fratricidal prince named Phraya Phan and history tells of the effects of peaceful Buddhism on the state, with the Wat Phra Pathom temple dating back to around 325 BCE. The city of U Thong protected its religious monuments and holy people with a large, oval-shaped moat."
# Chansen
chansen_heritage:0 "Heritage of Chansen"
chansen_heritage_desc:0 "Holding its origins in the late Iron Age, Chansen was a near-contemporary of early U Thong and other early Funan settlements. A mix of stone and iron tools, such as axes, have been found there which indicate long-term settlement and technological advancement on-site. The area is full of lowlands, and a great circular moat encircled the settlement for protection. Early Kendi-ware, Indian Red Polished Ware pitchers, have been found at the site as well, which indicates deep penetration of either merchant/travelers or Hindu/Buddhist missions."
# Kok Charoen
kok_charoen_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Neoliths"
kok_charoen_heritage_desc:0 "With occupation of the site going back as far as the 2nd millennium BCE, having one of the largest neolithic sites in Southeast Asia, Kok Charoen was a center for population and cultural growth and spread early on. Low mountains protected it from incursions by other settlements which accessed Bronze earlier than itself, so it was able to thrive in relative peace, allowing them to maintain their lifestyle for an extended period without outside motivation to progress technologically or socially."
# Chaibadan
chaibadan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Chaibadan"
chaibadan_heritage_desc:0 "Located on the Pak Sak rivery valley, Chaibadan benefitted from rich alluvial plains that absorbed the mineral-rich waters from the far away mountains. It also pushed its own goods further down the river, sending bronze bracelets, iron implements, polished stone adzes, and beads of precious stones/gold. The settlement was also able to obtain rarer materials such as jade to make jewelry for its upper class, as seen in their burials. Like in other places in modern Thailand, Indian Kendi-ware pitchers were found at the site, indicating that some of this trade may have made its way to the Ganges delta and beyond, and returned with travelers, merchants, and missionaries."
# Sab Champa
sab_champa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sirindhorn Champi Flower"
sab_champa_heritage_desc:0 "Notable as the unique and seemingly only location of the native Sirindhorn Champi flower, a unique type of magnolia, Sab Champa has a long history stretching back to the early 1st millennium BCE and was one of the settlements to welcome and embrace a large Buddhist community of travelers and scholars alike. The local flowers fed off the river-plains environment and made the area a peaceful paradise for such peaceful visitors as the monks."
# Pong Manao
pong_manao_heritage:0 "Heritage of Pong Manao"
pong_manao_heritage_desc:0 "Burials at the Pong Manao site have been found dated as early as the early 1st millennium BCE, dating to the late Bang Chiang Period. It was built around a local hilly area that protected it both from natural and man-made dangers, from flash-flooding to raiding. Burials were found with burnished red ware, bronze anklets, necklaces of carnelian, and beads of glass and agate. Local iron deposits allowed the construction of iron tools and weapons to help defend the well-fortified area from incursions."
# Kualadungun
kualadungun_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kuala Dungun"
kualadungun_heritage_desc:0 "Settled and having territories near and along the coast, Kuala Dungun benefited from trade that came down the Mae Nam river and connected with the greater Maritime Silk Road between Chinese and Indian markets. Local iron deposits allowed for the production of heavy metal objects and tools/weapons which would serve the settlement and their neighboring trade. Besides metallurgy, the people turned to agriculturalism and fishing."
# Petchabun
petchabun_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Diamond Mountain"
petchabun_heritage_desc:0 "Found in a fertile and mineral-rich area, Phetchabun has served as the seat of power for several polities. It is associated with the symbol of a diamond which represents the riches (including gold, silver, and other metals) found within the Phetchabun mountain range. The area is also home to the rare freshwater jellyfish, which makes this wealthy land a hazard to people who would reap its benefits."
# Phu Lon
phu_lon_heritage:0 "Heritage of Thattaradtha"
phu_lon_heritage_desc:0 "A precursor to a major Dvaravati city, Phu Lon is said in the wondrous Phra Lak Phra Lam, a Laotian Epic, to have been founded by the ancient prince called Thattaradtha after he had left the legendary Lao kingdom of Muon Inthapatha Maha Nakhone, where he had been denied the throne. While his original city had been on the western bank of the Mekong river, a Naga with seven heads emerged from the water to convince him to create a sister city on the right bank, which could be connected with the site of Phu Lon."
# Xiangkhoang
xiangkhoang_heritage:0 "Heritage of Giant Jars"
xiangkhoang_heritage_desc:0 "These people have lived along the Xiangkhoang Plateau, traversing the so-called 'Plain of Jars,' since the 2nd millennium BCE. Because their land was open and without a great many mountains or other natural obstacles, much trade passed through their borders and into the southern Chinese areas. The landscape is so strangely named for the great clusters of stone jars found in deposits along its stretches, which may have served as holding containers for goods ready to transport or be picked up, or held safely until trade would begin. Some legends say a race of giants walked the plateau, ruled by a large king named Khun Cheung - the jars were his creations, used to hold alcohol (rice wine) for his ultimate celebration."
# Non Nok That
non_nok_that_heritage:0 "Heritage of Non Nok Tha"
non_nok_that_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited since the Bronze Age, Non Nok Tha, meaning “Partridge Mound,” was a plentiful agricultural society, growing rice paddies, bananas, cotton, mulberry, jute, and the like in their well-watered and irrigated fields. The people here practiced human sacrifice at times, leaving skulls as votive gifts in burials and shrines to the gods. A wealthy and religiously fervent people, one would consider crossing them with much reserve and caution."
# Ban Chiang
ban_chiang_heritage:0 "Heritage of Little Crucibles"
ban_chiang_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited as early as the Neolithic period, the people of Ban Chiang favored red-on-buff pottery during the Hellenistic period and manufactured their own metal tools in crucibles. They had equal amounts of bronze anklets as they did bronze spear-heads, prepared for trade and war equally. Yet, unlike many urbanized centers that produced metals in factory-like settings, the small villages around Ban Chiang, having no great centralized state, each forged their own local copper alloys and such without the concentrated expertise a city would afford - quite an achievement."
# Ban Lum Khao
ban_lum_khao_heritage:0 "Heritage of Harsh Equalilty"
ban_lum_khao_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited since the later half of the 2nd millennium, Ban Lum Khao, located on the Khorat Plateau, showed how the harsh and jungle-ridden environment could affect the ancient peoples of Southeast Asia. The men and women both had their hardships, eating different diets, having altered statures and deteriorating teeth, and might have been seen by some Mediterranean city-dwellers as a strange being of another species. Yet, with its unique aspects of male vs. female living, the society of Ban Lum Khao was rather egalitarian in nature, where all members had to stick together to make each village succeed. Both male and female burials bore exquisite beads and bone-wares, so it seems the men and women shared the consequences and benefits of life more equally than most."
# Snay
snay_heritage:0 "Iron-Armed Heritage"
snay_heritage_desc:0 "An Iron Age settlement, Phum Snay thrived during the later half of the 1st millennium BCE. It held within its borders a very warlike people, each person going to the grave with a weapon or two to protect them in the life beyond - swords, daggers, and projectile devices. Each implement of war was iron-wrought with bronze adornment. Shoulder-decorations, akin to pauldrons, complemented these tools of violence within the warrior society."
# Loeu
loeu_heritage:0 "Temple-Builder Heritage"
loeu_heritage_desc:0 "A deeply pious country, many deities, new and old, have their temples set up on hills, in valleys, on in the tightest of corners. Like with other Southeast Asian settlements, Indian traders, merchants, and missionaries came here as well, creating the beginnings of a Shaivist cultic practice."
# Phnom
phnom_heritage:0 "Heritage of Lady Penh"
phnom_heritage_desc:0 "Located in roughly the same spot as the capital of modern Cambodia, the name of the Phnom center of Vyadhapura betrays the influence Indian migration and traders had on the development of the area, bringing both Hinduism and Buddhism to the lands. The settlement, as told in legend, was created by a local woman named Penh, sometimes referred to as Daun Penh (Lady Penh), which seems to indicate a princess or some form of soft royalty taking up the local throne just as happened in many other local foundation myths throughout western Southeast Asia. Surrounded by branches of a river, the land around the city is fertile, a reliable flood-plain, which sustains the many inhabitants."

### Southeast Asian TI Heritages
# Daze
daze_heritage:0 "Daze Heritage"
daze_heritage_desc:0 "Mentioned in the Chu poem “The Great Summons,” the Xianbei people, who are a branch of the Donghu group, were best known for their horse-riders in the eastern steppe within inner and outer modern Mongolia. They were feared for their skill in mounted archery. Those of Daze live on the steppe around modern Hulun Lake (one of the five largest freshwater lakes in the entire region), and were able to supply themselves off of the wealth of fish, shrimp, and sell the pearls that could be found. The surrounding wetlands and the closeby Amur river provide a lush environment that stands out in the colder and dryer steppe."
# Nanhe
nanhe_heritage:0 "Nanhe Heritage"
nanhe_heritage_desc:0 "The Shiwei people of Nanhe were of Xianbei stock. The “Verses of Chu” and other Chinese literature describes them as one among several groups of barbarians. Their ornate art consisted of steppe-related natural imagery, such as crouching or geometric animals. Horses can appear in golden leaf headdresses or other majestic pieces meant for ritual wearing. While they spoke a Mongolic or pre-Mongolic language, Turkic influence was present, hinting at the future of the region."
# Donghu
donghu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Five Barbarians"
donghu_heritage_desc:0 "First recorded in the 7th century BCE, the Donghu originated in Heibei, modern Inner Mongolia, but split off into several subgroups as they migrated south over the centuries. The craftsmen of their tribes were renowned for their ability to make things such as bows, carts, and other tools and vessels without the years of specialization that masters in the settled lands of Chu, Wei, or Qin required to match such artistry. The Donghu, sometimes known only as the Hu, upon breaking into five groups as tribes migrate and split off, were known as the Five Hu, or the Five Barbarians. King Wuling of Zhao had his military adopt Hu clothes and cavalry techniques, seeing the danger of their seasonal harassments and valuing the advantage of their techniques."
# Sushen
sushen_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Black Dragon"
sushen_heritage_desc:0 "With their capital in a place meaning 'blackwater,' the Sushen people have strong ties to the Amur river, known as the 'Black Dragon River.' Possibly speaking a form of Tungusic, they have been mentioned in the “Classic of Mountains and Sea” as a northeastern tribe in the frozen lands or upper steppe near the taiga regions. Stories tell how they lived equally in caves and in trees, hunting with the most basic wooden and flint tools. They paid their tribute to the southern Chinese in bundles of arrows."
# Funie
funie_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Second Sun"
funie_heritage_desc:0 "Living around the freshwater lake called Khanka/Xingkai, some say that the people of Funie were subject to witnessing a strange, large, and bright object which resembled a great pearl hovering over the lake now and then in the dead of night, like a new sun shining over that one area - at random it would shoot up into the air like a star, its brightness choked out by the black night. This wonder eclipsed the beauty and richness of the fish and other creatures which could be found in the lake's waters. Many refer to those living here as the Yilou, who live among forested mountains and hilltops. They were valuable to outsiders because their lands birthed red jade and quality sable-skins, and they were feared because their arrows were dipped in poisons."
# Fuyu
fuyu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the White-Robed Dongming"
fuyu_heritage_desc:0 "Those of Fuyu belonged to the Tungus branch of the Altaic peoples and are mentioned in the Huozhi Liezhuan chapter on profiteering in the Shiji history. The Fuyu trace their legendary heritage to the ancient Dongming of the nation called Suli, having previously been northern barbarians and having become eastern barbarians. They worked the fields and as much as they bred and rode their horses. Their king and tribal leader ruled over a council of people known by their animal - the cattle tribe, the pig tribe, the horse tribe, and so on. The men and women wore white clothes each day, and, when a husband died, his unwed younger brother would marry the widow. In war, they believed the hooves of an ox could predict the future."
# Baishan
baishan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the White Peak"
baishan_heritage_desc:0 "Known as the people of the White Mountain, on account of nearby Paektu Mountain, those in Baishan look down over their southern centralized neighbors, protected in the frigid heights. While the Paektu creates an environmental phenomenon for the occupants with the crater lake called “Heaven Lake” and fertile volcanic soil, it's also given a mystical quality, believed to be a homeland by peoples in the greater Korean areas. These people belonged to the greater Sushen group of taiga-dwellers, being used to the rugged lands up north."
# Huifa
huifa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mountain Shamans"
huifa_heritage_desc:0 "A tribe steeped in shaman culture and having attunement with the natural and supernatural order, the Huifa. Some say they worshiped a “Wood Lord” who watched them among the mountain forests, where divine songs would summon exotic beasts, incense would cause the birds to dance, and the beat of ceremonial drums would bring out the gods to appear in the sky. The area, now known as Jilin, was always rich in minerals and precious metals including gold, silver, gypsum, and iron."
# Joseon
joseon_heritage:0 "Heritage of God-King Dangun"
joseon_heritage_desc:0 "Legend tells how Gojoseon was founded by the god-king Dangun - son of the god-prince Hwanung and the bear-woman Ungnyeo - as far back as 2333 BCE. In the 12th century, stories also tell how a sage named Jizi/Gija of the Shang dynasty came to this spot after a period of wandering and became the great founder Gija Joseon. The lineage of these great founders is said to trace back to the Baekdu Mountain, the White-Tipped Mountain, where the Lord of Heaven brought Hwanung into the world. The settlement grew over time, made rich by the wealth it accrued in trading wares both north-south and east-west. The text called “The Growth of Yan,” written after the Yan people had explored the regions around them, alludes to as much, and further texts illuminate how Joseon grew into a powerful kingdom that was able to wage war against the Yan in the 4th century BCE, having grown as a city-state and engulfed its neighbors to become vassals and integral parts of its territory."
# Woju
woju_heritage:0 "Woju Heritage"
woju_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited by the Okjeo Korean people, Woju served as a balance in the scale which weighed the power of the Chinese against that of the large tribes such as the Goguryeo. Yet, while it was always being courted and influenced by the more centralized kingdoms and tribes, it retained its own native customs and governance strongly with its people keeping to their smaller villages and settlements on the seashore, having a hereditary chief in each village, cultivating the five grains which their fertile lands grow plenty of. Their spears defend their sandy beaches from foreign invaders while their few horses and oxen work the fields and their children prepare for perfectly-catered arranged-marriages."
# Dongwei
dongwei_heritage:0 "Dongwei Heritage"
dongwei_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Dongwei, also sometimes known as the Dongye, or Eastern Ye, maintained close cultural connections to the neighboring Goguryeo tribes, sharing their ethnic customs and language with those peoples and the Okjeo tribes. Known to the Chinese as one of the many 'eastern barbarians,' they are recorded as having practiced a festival called “Mucheon,” worshiping the heavens and the gods in them until the 10th month of the year - this may be connected with the Dongmaeng festival held in the Goguryeo lands at the same time. Both festivals held marital significance and display, with the Tiger god as the iconic deity praised during this period. To fund such festivities, the Dongwei farmed the normal grains as well as silkworms and hemp."
# Soknobulsa
soknobulsa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Militarized Border"
soknobulsa_heritage_desc:0 "Lying along the Han river, the only physical barrier between itself and the large kingdom of Joseon, Soknobulsa (also known as Songnobulsa) acted as a defendable buffer state as a subject of the Jin confederacy. Thus, it was always prepared for warfare and was protected by its overlord as the premier battlefield, should the north and south of the Korean peninsula collide."
# Musu
musu_heritage:0 "Musu Heritage"
musu_heritage_desc:0 "Also known at times as Mosuguk, Musu had a population of Mahan Korean people. The farmland around this place is the largest in the surrounding region, offering it an advantage in the ability to feed a large army - thus, it was a wonderfully valuable vassal to the Jin confederacy, acting as a base and a pit stop for armies traveling north to the border with Joseon."
# Gori
gori_heritage:0 "Gori Heritage"
gori_heritage_desc:0 "Known best for their long-lasting and pristinely-built temples, the people of Gori found solace in faith and ritual worship. Their temples complemented their local architecture and would be valued by their conquerors and rivals, not to be razed like normal cities and their structures."
# Jingug
jingug_heritage:0 "Jingug Heritage"
jingug_heritage_desc:0 "The State of Jin, otherwise known as the Jin Confederacy, controlled a large group of city-states and smaller groups in the southern Korean lands and came into being as early as the 4th century BCE. Although its structure of governance was quite complex, managing so many vassals and subject territories, it was still able to have a strong foreign presence, sending out many ambassadors and messengers to far-off courts in order to contend in the greater Korean political arena. To fuel their growing and centralizing population, they imported metal components and ores from the Chinese frequently. They also held several cultural ties to people on the isles of Japan, crafting similar tools and weapons as the Japanese Yayoi people and possibly speaking, in some areas, a Japonic language before the cementing of a Korean linguistic continuum in the area."
# Damna
damna_heritage:0 "Heritage of a Mystical Box"
damna_heritage_desc:0 "Sometimes known as the barbarian island, Damna, modern Jeju, was a temperate but majestic home for its people, with basalt cliffs and a volcanic origin. Damn/Tamna is said to have been settled by three divine founders, those being Go, Yang, and Bu, who each emerged from holes in the ground some time in the 24th century BCE - the current inhabitants still protect and venerate the supposed holes, perhaps awaiting the emergence of new divines. Other stories speak of a strange box which washed up onto the shorelines one day, inside of which were three women, cows, horses, and seeds for sowing. The people of Damna traded both with the Chinese to the west and the Korean peoples on the mainland to the north."
# Gijeo
gijeo_heritage:0 "Gijeo Heritage"
gijeo_heritage_desc:0 "Feeding off the Nakdong River, the people of Gijeo were of Jinhan stock but made local traditions and festivals very important to their unique culture and livelihood. They held a tradition of mask-wearing and ritual meats/dishes, but their society became more muddled with the introduction of more consolidated norms imposed by the Jin rulers of the Jin confederacy which puppeted Gijeo."
# Uyu
uyu_heritage:0 "Heritage of Snow Crabs"
uyu_heritage_desc:0 "Known for its wealth of snow crabs (which thrive in the cooler subtropical climate), Uyu, also written as U-yu, was home to one of the northern groups of the Jinhan tribes. The tribes-folk may have even worshiped the large invertebrates in relation to divines - perhaps specifically to a sea god, or something much more exotic."
# Yeodam
yeodam_heritage:0 "Heritage of Flying Spirits"
yeodam_heritage_desc:0 "Subjected to a subtropical humid climate, the people of Yeodam belonged to the more regional Byeonhan tribes who had local traditions such as burying feathers in burial pottery so that the deceased might be able to fly into the heavens once they reached the afterlife. They also practiced full-body tattooing or animalistic imagery."
# Geungi
geungi_heritage:0 "Geungi Heritage"
geungi_heritage_desc:0 "First inhabited in the second half of the 2nd millennium, Geun-Gi started as a place for prosperous fishing villages, where the waters offered safety from the rather harsh, hot summers in the area. Religious festivals and rituals developed around these same beaches and the peoples' connection with the sea at large."
# Ballo
ballo_heritage:0 "Heritage of Oriental Melons"
ballo_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Ballo subsist off of the many fruits and vegetables  and grains their home provides, but the most notable of these is the oriental melon, which grows plentifully in the humid continental climate - a juicy treat for any social class. Occupying the area since the 2nd millennium BCE, they were culturally influenced by the southeastern Korean peoples of the Jinhan."
# Bulsa
bulsa_heritage:0 "Bulsa Heritage"
bulsa_heritage_desc:0 "Kept fertile by the Upo wetlands, the people of Bulsa were well-liked and, beyond simply trading southwards to the ports of Guya, were regularly visited by diplomats and emissaries from southern cities, who saw the Bulsa as a politically strong and valuable site to be in good standing with."
# Dongno
dongno_heritage:0 "Dongno Heritage"
dongno_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Dongno have lived on their island homes since the Neolithic Period, and when the kingdom of Dongno/Dokro came to be, it was split into two halves, administratively. Even though they were mainly islanders, the people of this kingdom shared ties with the great Byeonhan peoples of the Korean southlands who sent trade goods down the rivers, through the deltas, and past the ports of Dongno islands. Thus, trade was their bread and butter, making them also politically relevant, as they had a say in which ships could safely transport goods over their waters."
# Gojamidong
gojamidong_heritage:0 "Heritage of Paleontologists"
gojamidong_heritage_desc:0 "Besides having a robust naval industry, the people of Gojamidong were a curious lot, quick to learn, and even interested in studying their own past. The area is famous for being littered with dinosaur skeletons and other prehistoric fossils/remains. Together these elements created an inquisitive society and one which can prosper and study new ideas through extensive trade with foreign lands."
# Anya
anya_heritage:0 "Heritage of Watermelons"
anya_heritage_desc:0 "Anya is famed for its watermelons and a large agricultural sector, supplying its vast markets with fresh produce - there may have even been an ancient festival related to the watermelon, either as an offering to the gods or as a vessel for bestowing powers and divine favor on the people. The people of Anya left many rich burial tombs which continue to stand out as notable monuments on the landscape."
# Mirimidong
mirimidong_heritage:0 "Mirimidong Heritage"
mirimidong_heritage_desc:0 "Mirimidong was one of twelve city states in the area of the Jinhan peoples who relied on trade destined for the southern shore. The settlement itself has known many names, but, as an idea, it has been remembered as a place full of rich fields, be they wheat fields, watery fields, or the Galaxy fields which are sometimes named for their mythical wonder."
# Yeomhae
yeomhae_heritage:0 "Yeomhae Heritage"
yeomhae_heritage_desc:0 "People have been here since the Paleolithic Period, with stone tools found within burials. With deep port-favoring shores and a rich density in minerals, the lands surrounding Yeomhae have always favored its rise as a city. They were active participants in the grand Maritime Silk Road, and were able to import Persian silver, glass, and peacock tails to enamor the nobility and dazzle the populace."
