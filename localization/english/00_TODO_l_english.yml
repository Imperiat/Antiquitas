flavor_gaul.46.t: "Honor Ancestors"
flavor_gaul.46.desc: "Although it comes at a premium - one hundred gold coins, to be exact - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has insisted on the proper rites being observed when it involves honoring our ancestors, no matter what the costs might be. While this is one of our oldest religious traditions, in lean years, we have not done as much as we could, but [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has put an end to this aberration.\n\nMoving forward, no more corners will be cut - full sacrificial rites shall be held for our forebears, a sign of the renewed piety that is possessing the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
flavor_gaul.46.a: "It is our duty to honor those who came before us"
flavor_gaul.47.t: "Preparations for Burial"
flavor_gaul.47.desc: "As the period of mourning for our previous leader begins, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been privately approached by the Wise Ones and the Elders, who insist that we honor our old ways by giving the deceased a proper [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] Wagon Burial. This is a great honor, reserved only for the most elite in our society, but whether or not we proceed is entirely up to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName].\n\nAlthough it is unpleasant to discuss financial matters when our entire nation is grieving, there are substantial costs associated with wagon burials and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has to sign off on the purchases."
flavor_gaul.47.a: "Yes, everything shall be prepared according to tradition"
flavor_gaul.47.b: "We simply cannot afford this right now - there will be no wagon"
flavor_gaul.48.t: "Burying The Wagon"
flavor_gaul.48.desc: "There is a somber procession taking place a few hour's ride outside of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] as the final preparations are being made for one of our most ancient traditions; the wagon burial of a cultural elite.\n\nAll manner of grave goods are lowered into the ground - sumptuous dining dishes wrought in silver, torcs of gold and ceremonial fur capes, drinking horns and gem-encrusted banquet trays - as the requisite animals and slaves are sacrificed nearby. Everything has been done to exacting standards, and the omens show that the gods are very pleased by our attention to the finer details.\n\nThere is a respectful silence as the last of the earth falls over the wagon, and one by one, everyone turns towards [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who offers a few words."
flavor_gaul.48.a: "As we remember our obligations to the dead, may they give us their blessings"
flavor_gaul.49.t: "Bribe The Council"
flavor_gaul.49.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a reputation for not allowing anything to get in the way of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] plans being completed; every military matter that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has encountered, for example, has been handled promptly and ruthlessly, with an efficiency that could be mistaken for callousness.\n\nIt should come as no surprise to those paying attention that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] would resort to political bribery in order to move the gears of state. Every bag of silver handed over, every golden torc, was delivered with an unspoken threat to seal the deal."
flavor_gaul.49.a: "If my enemies won't accept my coins, let them receive my daggers..."
flavor_gaul.50.t: "Monarchic Ambition"
flavor_gaul.50.desc: "Although not everyone is happy today - there are those who ridiculously believe themselves to be better candidates for the throne - a momentous occasion is upon us; under the watchful eye of our Elders and the Wise One, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is undergoing ritual purification for the coronation ceremony later on today in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. When the sun sets in a few hours and the sacrifices are complete, we shall have a new form of government.\n\nAlthough our people have never been governed by a true sovereign before, it has been acknowledged that the time is finally here. May the gods continue to grant [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the wisdom and intelligence to carry our nation forward."
flavor_gaul.50.a: "I shall not let you down, but will do everything for Treveria always!"
flavor_gaul.51.t: "Triumph in Treveria"
flavor_gaul.51.desc: "When all is said and done, there is much for our people to be proud of. Not only have we destroyed the inferior tribes that surrounded us, absorbing their strength and power into our own, but we have started to create a civilization that is truly worthy of being respected. We have also raised up a line of Kings to rule over us, and our engineers have tamed the wild woodlands, building cities and magnificent edifices that dazzle the eye with their cleverness.\n\nWhile the people have done much to deserve these honors themselves, many admit that we would not be as far along as we are without [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - even [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s detractors admit that we have been blessed with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] leadership."
flavor_gaul.51.a: "All hail Treveria!"
flavor_gaul.52.t: "Treveria"
flavor_gaul.52.desc: "While [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has certainly serviced our people well, lately, there is a growing chorus demanding that we move our capital to [GetProvince('(int32)3690').GetName]. Not only does the city of Treveria have river access, which is vital for its economic success, but it is also located on the plains, which gives our people room to expand in the future. The forests near Caranusca are proving to be a hindrance to development, as everything costs more.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a decision to make."
flavor_gaul.52.a: "Let us move our capital - there are no reasons for us to stay at an inferior site"
flavor_gaul.52.b: "We are not abandoning our ancestral homelands"
flavor_gaul.53.t: "Treverian Belgium"
flavor_gaul.53.desc: "Although the civilized nations fear the #E Belgae#! the most when it comes to the tribes of Gaul, in time, they will learn that the bravest and fiercest warriors come from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] levies. For what are the Belgae compared to us? We have destroyed the myth of their superiority and have driven them back into their villages and settlements."
flavor_gaul.53.a: "I shall lead our armies to victory over all of our enemies!"

roman_12_mission_task_1_claims_tt:0 ""

me_roman_missions_inv.10.t: "Illyrian War"
me_roman_missions_inv.10.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have received grim news this morning - the perfidious #E Illyrians#! have attacked us! Their barbarous hordes are already on the march, vowing to sack any Roman cities they come across - it behooves us to meet them in the field before they have a chance to despoil the countryside.\n\nWe hope that this conflict ends quickly, because the entire region has the potential to ignite if we are not careful."
me_roman_missions_inv.10.a: "Begun, the Illyrian Wars have..."
me_roman_missions_inv.11.t: "Triumph Over the Savage Lands"
me_roman_missions_inv.11.desc: "Although there were those who disagreed with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s decision to send our soldiers into the lands of the [GetProvince('(int32)4053').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName], all are silent in this hour of victory - truly, how could anyone have doubted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who has consistently demonstrated brilliance at every turn?\n\nEven now, the naysayers, their wagging tongues choked by jealousy, watch silently from the sidelines as a triumphal arch is erected in [GetProvince('(int32)1').GetName] - an eternal monument to the wisdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]. All hail the power of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"
me_roman_missions_inv.11.a: "This region shall make a fine addition to the lands of the Romans"
me_roman_missions_inv.12.t: "Illyrian Emissaries"
me_roman_missions_inv.12.desc: "Because the Roman people value friendship and peace over the alternatives, we have decided to send emissaries to the #E Illyrians#!, hoping beyond hope that the barbarians can be shown the error of their ways thus far. If, gods willing, they are willing to rectify their behavior, then perhaps we will avoid hostilities, but that depends on them entirely at this point.\n\nWe don't just give everyone the opportunity to become our #Y Client State#! - they should think long and hard before responding."
me_roman_missions_inv.12.a: "Tell our men to take as much time as they need and to be generous"
me_roman_missions_inv.12.b: "This is official business, not a vacation - be professional"
me_roman_missions_inv.13.t: "Illyrian Emissaries"
me_roman_missions_inv.13.desc: "Great news from our diplomats! The Illyrians have seen the wisdom in becoming one of our client states and have agreed to submit peacefully. Everything we wanted has happened, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]! We should celebrate tonight."
me_roman_missions_inv.13.a: "Bring out the best wine! Falernian if we have it!"
me_roman_missions_inv.14.t: "Illyrian Emissaries"
me_roman_missions_inv.14.desc: "It shouldn't be too surprising to hear that the Illyrians have rejected our offer, for everyone knows how daft they are. What a calamity they have brought down on the heads of their children and mothers! We pray that war between our nations does not happen, for it will be an unfair pairing - we will obliterate them without remorse."
me_roman_missions_inv.14.a: "Well, they are barbarians after all...what did we expect?"

punic_resurgence_12_title: "Infighting Amongst Allies"
punic_resurgence_12_desc: "Although disagreements between partners is a common enough story, we have heard stories of some of the arguments between our League members becoming a bit too pointed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. It seems that camps are starting to coalesce around a couple of charismatic figures, who are taking the opportunity to give grand orations that denounce each other.\n\nAll of this, as you can imagine, is a distraction to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] business."
punic_resurgence_12.a: "Pay close attention to the troublemakers"
punic_resurgence_12.b: "We do not care about this matter at all"
punic_resurgence_13_title: "State Leaves League"
punic_resurgence_13_desc: "We have received messengers in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that bring a bit of unfortunate news - our Punic League has lost a member, for whatever ridiculous reason they are citing."
punic_resurgence_13.a: "We don't need them anyways, but this is annoying nevertheless"
punic_resurgence_16_title: "An Enemy Force Has Landed!"
punic_resurgence_16_desc: "Grim news, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - the reports are incomplete, no doubt due to the haste required to inform us, but it seems that an enemy force of indeterminate size has landed on our shores.\n\nBest keep this news from the men, as their morale is suffering as it is."
punic_resurgence_16.a: "We shall meet their forces in battle and push them back into the sea!"

me_macedon_1_legacy.132.t: "Treaty of Mylasa"
me_macedon_1_legacy.132.desc: "The text of what came to be known as the 'Treaty of Mylasa' wasted no words on formal introductions or flowery language, no invocations to the gods asking for blessings of health - a sign of how far relations have deteriorated at this point.\n\nThe only information in the treaty was the simple demarcation of boundaries."

#LOBBY RECOMMENDED COUNTRY INTROS
joseon_start:0 "#T Joseon#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nNearly two thousand years ago, the Kingdom of Joseon was established by the semi-mythical leader Dangun, and her people have struggled ever since then to hold on to what they have. In recent years, conflicts with Yan to the west have resulted in Joseon ceding vast tracts of land to her neighbor, and the threat of tribal invasion from the north and east remains present."
chu_start:0 "#T Chu#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAlthough Chu was once a powerful and stable country, the envy of those around her, the last few decades have seen unchecked corruption spreading throughout the government. The people's suffering is compounded by the ineffective and duplicitous leadership that has choked the state, as poor diplomatic decisions have left Chu isolated and paranoid."
qin_start:0 "#T Qin#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAs all of China is consumed by the conflagration of the Warring States Period, the state of Qin is slowly but surely beginning to dominate her neighbors. Strengthened by innovative Legalist Reforms and bolstered by an indomitable martial spirit, Qin stands on the precipice of history."
yamato_start:0 "#T Yamato#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nFar to the East lies the island of Wa, which is partitioned and divided between the various tribes that live on its shores. Life can be difficult on Wa; the region of Yamato, a small enclave of farmland surrounded by rolling hills, is home to a sturdy and industrious people that are prepared for anything."

thaton_start:0 "#T Thaton#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nThaton in the Mon tongue of the natives was called as #E Sadhuim#!, which in turn came from the word Sudhammapura, an Indo-Aryan word meaning #E 'Assembly of the Gods.'#! The city-state of Sadhuim was established in at least the 4th century BC and became rich from trade between Sri Lanka. The Kingdom, colloquially called the #E Thaton Kingdom#!, would go on to unite much of the Southern Mons and enter into legend, before being conquered by the #E Kingdom of Pegu#!. In its long legacy from its founding to its ultimate destruction, it left a lasting cultural legacy that remained in the lore of its eventual faith forever."
qi_start:0 "#T Qi#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAt the beginning of the Warring States period, three great powers stood above all others; Qin, Chu, and Qi. Over the last couple hundred years, Qi has sided with its various neighbors when it was politically convenient to do so, entering conflicts with former allies and managing to build up its holdings, especially around its capital of Linzi."
phnom_start:0 "#T Phnom#!\nDifficulty: #Y Medium#!\n\nAt the tip of the Mekong Delta, where the waters of the mighty river empty into the South China Sea, the settled tribes of Phnom make their home. Their homelands are blessed with natural wealth, and foreign merchants often visit their capital city of Vyadhapura for the best prices on these luxury goods."


#AOS GOVERNMENTS
chinese_empire:0 "Chinese Empire"
chinese_empire_desc:0 "As shown by the reigns of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, in which the divine authority of the Emperor was demonstrated for all under Heaven to see, the Imperial Form of government remains the supreme achievement of political life, all but ensuring peace and prosperity for conscientious stewards of the Mandate of Heaven."

enfeoffment_zhourites:0 "Enfeoffment Zhourites"
enfeoffment_zhourites_desc:0 "The system of governance created by our predecessors in the Shang Dynasty remains a viable way of ruling the people to this very day. By creating a vast, decentralized bureaucratic state, in which lands and authority are meted out to powerful vassals in return for oaths of submission, true peace can be secured."

chinese_duhufu:0 "Duhufu"
chinese_duhufu_desc:0 "In order to properly adminster the hinterlands, special types of administrative districts known as 'Duhufu' are established as ways to entrench the Imperial power in the lands that are distant from our capital. The governor of a Duhufu has unquestioned military and economic authority, carrying out the commands of their superiors with one voice."

#ACB HERITAGES (TI HERITAGES)

qin_heritage:0 "Qin Heritage"
qin_heritage_desc:0 "The Qin excel at organization, with an affinity for reform that has quickly propelled these people to lofty heights involving military and legal matters. Their fearsome armies are disciplined and faithful, the veterans of many successful campaigns, although their inexperience at sea leaves something to be desired - a rare weakness that their many foes hope to exploit."

qi_heritage:0 "Qi Heritage"
qi_heritage_desc:0 "The Qi are a bundle of contradictions to those unfamiliar with their ways; seemingly disorganized, yet inhabiting cities built to exacting standards, blessed with material wealth yet cursed with an uncaring aristocracy that is disinterested in ruling...\nDespite these surface flaws, the Qi respond rapidly to external threats, abandoning the pretense of chaos in favor of a unified response."

zhao_heritage:0 "Zhao Heritage"
zhao_heritage_desc:0 "Zhao was created in the aftermath of the Partition of Jin, and considering the social upheavals that followed this momentous event, the people of Zhao had to quickly adapt to the new realities presented to them - a task at which they have excelled. Although they struggle to build up the areas they have conquered, their armies are feared for the speed in which they move; a skill the Zhao have honed, due to the constant threats of enemy raids."

chu_heritage:0 "Chu Heritage"
chu_heritage_desc:0 "The Yellow River Basin has given birth to many exceptional cultures, and the Chu are predominant among them. The Chu retain some of their primordial connections to the gods, being blessed with highly gifted shamans, and their music is known for its philosophical musings, revealing the intellectual curiosity that is a hallmark of this people."

yue_heritage:0 "Yue Heritage"
yue_heritage_desc:0 "The Yue people are respected for many things, including their tradition of metalworking, which has no equal among their peers. Hailed as exceptional seamen, the Yue dominate the seas around them, with a naval tradition that is predicated upon centuries of experience plying the waterways."

wei_heritage:0 "Wei Heritage"
wei_heritage_desc:0 "The Partition of Jin resulted in the people of Wei being given their own lands to administer, thanks to the military victories secured by the great general Wen. The Wei are known for their speed in all things; their armies travel faster than others, and their cities sprout like mushrooms, although, in their haste to build permanent structures, their infrastructure is not erected as thoroughly as others."

wei4_heritage:0 "Weii Heritage"
wei4_heritage_desc:0 "The Partition of Jin resulted in the people of Wei being given their own lands to administer, thanks to the military victories secured by the great general Wen. Over time, the Weii developed slight variances that distinguish their culture from their cousins the Wei, with an emphasis on intellectual pursuits replacing the focus on martial achievements. While this has promoted an advanced society, the army is not as capable in the field as it could be."

song_heritage:0 "Song Heritage"
song_heritage_desc:0 "The history of the Song is filled with conflicts with their neighbors, yet the might of this people has not been extinguished by the desires of their enemies. The Song have a well-established mercantile tradition, with their cities being hailed as pinnacles of civilization; these benefits come at a cost, however, for their people are more loyal to the state than they are to any particular leader."

lu_heritage:0 "Lu Heritage"
lu_heritage_desc:0 "The Lu are surrounded by enemies that openly covet their lands, so it should come as no surprise that the people of Lu have developed a society that is able to forcefully respond to the provocations of their neighbors. Despite these ever-present threats, the Lu are a famously cheerful people, making their civilization an attractive one. Relying on themselves for all things, the Lu distrust distant authority figures, including their own rulers."

han_heritage:0 "Han Heritage"
han_heritage_desc:0 "The Han people traditionally hail from a mountainous region that is difficult for armies to traverse through, and this accident of nature has been embraced by the inhabitants, who have incorporated these defenses into their military doctrines. Their nimble-footed archers train in the rocky defiles and craggy valleys of their homeland, raining devastation upon their foes before they are seen, and disappear into the badlands just as quickly."

yan_heritage:0 "Yan Heritage"
yan_heritage_desc:0 "Nestled between the wild Steppe kingdoms to the North and the settled civilizations of the South, the Yan find themselves with one foot firmly planted in both camps; seeing the value in maintaining a strong network of fortifications, a trick they learned from their civilized neighbors, the Yan also emphasize a powerful cavalry, no doubt due to their frequent skirmishes with the barbarian hordes."

zhou_heritage:0 "Zhou Heritage"
zhou_heritage_desc:0 "To be a part of the Zhou is to partake of an honor with practically no equal, for it was the Zhou that laid low the power of the Shang, establishing an illustrious Dynasty that survives into present times. Although the military hegemony of the Zhou is a shadow of what it once was, being forced by circumstance to rely on the vassalship of ambitious warlords, it would be premature to claim that the glory days of the Zhou are gone forever."

goguryeo_heritage:0 "Goguryeo Heritage"
goguryeo_heritage_desc:0 "The Goguryeo made the decision long ago to eschew the trappings of the civilized world, preferring to trust in their daunting fortifications and archer's bowstrings rather than relying on the pampered musings of a philosopher's treatise to guide their people. They are rumored to be the best bowmen the world has ever seen, never allowing their enemies the chance to test the strength of their city walls."

baekje_heritage:0 "Baekje Heritage"
baekje_heritage_desc:0 "The Baekje tribes settled in their homelands long ago, moving away from the coasts while making a concerted effort to maintain the naval traditions that had served their ancestors so well. While their military infrastructure is not as strong as it could be, the Baekje more than make up for this perceived shortcoming with their increased economic activities."

saro_heritage:0 "Saro Heritage"
saro_heritage_desc:0 "The Saro are an erudite people, who have seen firsthand what the application of wisdom can do for one's society; as such, there is an emphasis on academic traditions that make the Saro civilization exceptional, although there are some that argue that the atmosphere of intellectual permissiveness has damaged loyalty to the state."

guya_heritage:0 "Guya Heritage"
guya_heritage_desc:0 "At some point in their history, the Guya made a fateful decision that has had important ramifications for their culture; by purposefully choosing to lower the taxes on their people, the Guya have created conditions that allow trade to flourish in their capital, which is guarded and protected by armies with an unusually high morale."

yamato_heritage:0 "Yamato Heritage"
yamato_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Yamato are natural leaders, blessed with a large and fruitful populace, and are known and respected for their religious traditions, which they faithfully execute with the utmost piety. When compared to their neighbors, their relative isolation has hurt their diplomatic reputation; they are rumored to be untrusting of strangers."

chinese_heritage:0 "Chinese Heritage"
chinese_heritage_desc:0 "Although the tax receipts are not as healthy as those compared to the surrounding people, those with a Chinese heritage are gifted with a growing populace and an exceptional diplomatic corps, able to improve a neighbor's opinions with an ease that is the envy of less distinguished courts."

loulan_heritage:0 "Loulan Heritage"
loulan_heritage_desc:0 "Sitting at the edge of the Lop Desert, which joins the Tarim Basin, it sat at the beginning of the Northern Route which would become one of the main threads of the Silk Road. The quick-growing and cosmopolitan cities of the Loulan Kingdom allowed for it to control much of the trade in the area and to expand, encompassing rival cities in order to negate neighborly competition. It sits poised to control much of the Tarim Basin with its growing power."

### Southeast Asian TI Heritages
# Pegu
pegu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sea Pyu"
pegu_heritage_desc:0 "Downstream from Sri Ksetra, there is a legend of a place called 'Pinle Pyu' which was adjacent to the sea. Large in size, the settlements around the seaside contain records of Brahmi script. It is still uncertain whether this site was the upstream location of Ingapu or somewhere more southern, perhaps closer to the settlement of Pegu which was a Mon-culture stronghold. Artifacts from the area date to the Paleolithic period at the earliest."
# Thaton
thaton_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Theravadan Hall of the Gods"
thaton_heritage_desc:0 "While the stories claim that Thaton was a product of the age of the Buddha, built during the life of the holy man, it is more firmly understood that the kingdom of Thaton existed from at least the 4th century BCE. Trading heavily with India and Sri Lanka, many Buddhist people flocked here and set up the foundation for the Theravada school of Buddhism. Much of this can be attributed to the work of Moggaliputta-Tissa, the monk responsible for many overseas missions. Thaton thus, in stories, derived its name from Suvarnabhumi, meaning 'assembly of the gods.' Thus this holy place served as a basis for continuous Buddhist spread thereafter."
# Yilumo
yilumo_heritage:0 "Heritage of Yilumo"
yilumo_heritage_desc:0 "One of the city-states the Chinese would pass or stop at on their way to Indian markets, Yilumo was one of the early Mon settlements on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. While the northern Indian territories promised Chinese merchants pearls and opaque glass, coastal sites such as Yilumo provided some of the harder trade goods, like raw lumber and other natural necessities that assisted in facilitating the trade route."
# Tenasserim
tenasserim_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sea Gypsies"
tenasserim_heritage_desc:0 "The archipelago which surrounds the coast of the Tenasserim region is home to a vast array of life, from whales and Irrawaddy dolphins to whale sharks and dugongs. Such a wildlife diversity in the bay and among the mangrove forests which cross the waters allowed for the people to lean heavily on a fishing lifestyle. However, the islands also lent themselves to Chinese and other merchants and sailors as hideouts and alternative pathways to the open waters which were subject to monsoons and other dangers. The coast thus brought riches to the coastal settlements which had their own goods to trade as well. Ancient Tavoy was loaded with tungsten, tin, and other useful metals that could be traded to more centralized city-building civilizations."
# Khao Sam Kaeo
khao_sam_kaeo_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Port of Ideas"
khao_sam_kaeo_heritage_desc:0 "An important gateway in the Maritime Silk Road, the site of Khao Sam Kaeo came to be by at least the 4th century BCE. Chinese, Philippine, Taiwanese, and other types of goods crossed through their waters and territory in order to access the Indian markets to the west. However, many craftsmen and traders also stayed in the port-city and turned it into a bustling hub of knowledge and production, much more than just a waystation. The silks that were exchanged in its markets appeared as often as new peoples and ideas, leading to a great mixture of technological influences and progress. The local material culture shows such a mixture of peoples in its many unique art styles and products such as stone adzes and jewelry."
# Khuan Lukpad
khuan_lukpad_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Malay Processing Center"
khuan_lukpad_heritage_desc:0 "This site served as a trading post which imported and Indian raw materials and produced finished goods for eastern markets - such is known from their many ring molds (likely meant to be used with gold) and seal molds. From India, they also received goods as far aways as Middle Eastern markets of Persia. Brahmi inscriptions and some Tamil artifacts indicate a possibility of Indian craftsmen also setting up shop in the port in order to be closer to Chinese and other eastern merchants on their way around the Malay peninsula."
# Panpan
panpan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Red Earth Land"
panpan_heritage_desc:0 "While not a major hub in the region, the kingdom of Panpan succeeded in growing a lively trading economy that interacted with the Chinese and other East Asian markets to its north. Strangely enough, their contact with Indian markets to the west actually led to a significant and growing Hindu population which colored the daily life of an otherwise Austronesian populace, influencing local wares and practices in the area. They were known by Chinese sources possibly as the 'Red Earth Land,' perhaps on account of their local soil/clay/pottery or other goods with a penchant for red coloration."
# Kedah
kedah_heritage:0 "Heritage of Ancient Ocean-Lords"
kedah_heritage_desc:0 "Established in the early 8th century BCE, the kingdom of Kedah and the settlement of Sungai Batu were older than Rome itself and were set up for major success in naval trade from the beginning. Iron was accessible, and their position in the Malay peninsula, both close to the Strait of Malacca and on the same latitude line as Ceylon (Sri Lanka) allowed ships to most easily sail directly to and access Ceylon and South Indian markets by leaving from their port as opposed to any others. However, they were not simply a trading station for others to pass through, and built their own fleet of Austronesian/Malay ships to bring their native goods westward. Reports tell of them having light vessels for local transportation and traffic, larger vessels for major transfers of goods, and great ocean-going vessels which took their own sailors directly to Indian, Sumatran, and Bangli ports and markets. They held a powerful command over the ocean and the ability to sail it."
# Langkashuka
langkashuka_heritage:0 "Heritage of Merong the 'Alexandrian'"
langkashuka_heritage_desc:0 "One of the older successful seaports on the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula), the Kingdom of Langkashuka and the settlement of Pattani were only a bit younger than Old Kedah. It was supposedly founded by a king named Merong Mahawangsa, who supposedly traveled and learned from many great Empires both east and west, and even fought a great phoenix called the Garuda on his naval travels. Some stories claim he was a descendant or relative of Alexander the Great, but most of all his tales and aspects bleed of legend and superstition. What the reality of this founder may, however, betray, was the reality that many Indian travelers, traders, and Buddhist missionaries arrived at the port of Pattani and became integral components of the kingdom, altering its populace’s identity and faith."
# Kelantan
kelantan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Malaysian Ghosts"
kelantan_heritage_desc:0 "The history and foundation of Kelantan are shrouded in myth - the land is said to have once been walked by giants (To' Gedambai), with a great Naga coming onto the shore with the push of a flood. A Tiger roamed the forest, the Hantu Belian, stalking its prey, and the aboriginals (To' Bomor), hid in the crevices, tiny black youths which some consider to have been the ghosts of the dead. Other tales claim the city was founded by a queen of the Sakai named Gunong Ayam. With a largely agrarian economy/society and some of the largest mountains in the Malay peninsula to separate it from other areas, the land of Kelantan is full of mystery and secrets."
# Gangga Negara
gangga_negara_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Far Ganges"
gangga_negara_heritage_desc:0 "Gangga Negara, meaning 'city on the Ganges,' takes its name from the Northwestern Indian Kambuja traders and merchants that settled the area along with many others in the Malay peninsula. In contrast, the settlement of Beruas takes its name from the local Beruas tree and fruit. Some stories tell how the kingdom was founded by Raja Ganji Sarjuna of Old Kedah, a nearby neighboring and older kingdom. Like other traveling kings, this man was supposedly a descendant of Alexander the Great. The Indian settlement, however, did introduce Hinduism to the Malay natives to create a vibrant cultural and religious mixture when considering their art and cult sites."
# Selangor
selangor_heritage:0 "Heritage of a Bronze Klang"
selangor_heritage_desc:0 "With its most important city of Klang having been inhabited since the early Bronze Age, the territory of Selangor has long been a player in Malaysian geo-politics. The city of Klang itself fueled the power of Selangor with a tin-rich valley and the ability to make quality bronzes. Their metalworkers could fashion such wonderful objects as the Klang-type bell, iron tools called 'ape-bones,' and bronze drums meant either for war or ritual festivities. Connected by tich waterways to the sea, it could transport these metal luxuries and necessities to trading partners all over."
# Pahang
pahang_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mahang Tree"
pahang_heritage_desc:0 "Taking both its name and border from the Pahang river, which itself supposedly received its name from a legendary mahang tree that stretched across the river with its roots, settlements within the Kingdom of Pahang have existed since the Mesolithic period. Bronze, especially in the form of war-drums, became prominent by 400 BCE, and goldworking became a mainstay in production and trade, helping to give the Malay peninsula its known title of the 'Golden Chersonese.' However, while the area was a cradle of Malay culture and civilization, it often found itself subordinate to Funan-area kingdoms and influenced by those far-off courts."
# Kota Gelanggi
kota_gelanggi_heritage:0 "Heritage of Malaccan Treasures"
kota_gelanggi_heritage_desc:0 "Possibly known to Mediterranean cultures as Sabana/Sabara, or the port of Nominon Emporium, Kota Gelanggi and the modern-Singapore area were a pivotal point in the Maritime Silk Road, controlling the Strait of Malacca. The settlement of Kota Gelanggi itself was quite rich in its surrounding natural resources and the profits of its trade - a fort or palace made all out of black stone and a name derived from something akin to 'Treasury of Jewels.' It is no surprise that this was therefore a wealthy and prosperous site, gaining the awe and jealousy of its neighbors."
# Shenli
shenli_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Golden Buddhist Cradle"
shenli_heritage_desc:0 "The origin place of Dvaravati culture, U Thong city and the Shenli territories were rich in natural resources, with U Thong being known as a city of gold, or the “Golden Cradle.” However, it was a city lost in dichotomy - legends tell of its founding by a fratricidal prince named Phraya Phan and history tells of the effects of peaceful Buddhism on the state, with the Wat Phra Pathom temple dating back to around 325 BCE. The city of U Thong protected its religious monuments and holy people with a large, oval-shaped moat."
# Chansen
chansen_heritage:0 "Heritage of Chansen"
chansen_heritage_desc:0 "Holding its origins in the late Iron Age, Chansen was a near-contemporary of early U Thong and other early Funan settlements. A mix of stone and iron tools, such as axes, have been found there which indicate long-term settlement and technological advancement on-site. The area is full of lowlands, and a great circular moat encircled the settlement for protection. Early Kendi-ware, Indian Red Polished Ware pitchers, have been found at the site as well, which indicates deep penetration of either merchant/travelers or Hindu/Buddhist missions."
# Kok Charoen
kok_charoen_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Neoliths"
kok_charoen_heritage_desc:0 "With occupation of the site going back as far as the 2nd millennium BCE, having one of the largest neolithic sites in Southeast Asia, Kok Charoen was a center for population and cultural growth and spread early on. Low mountains protected it from incursions by other settlements which accessed Bronze earlier than itself, so it was able to thrive in relative peace, allowing them to maintain their lifestyle for an extended period without outside motivation to progress technologically or socially."
# Chaibadan
chaibadan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Chaibadan"
chaibadan_heritage_desc:0 "Located on the Pak Sak rivery valley, Chaibadan benefitted from rich alluvial plains that absorbed the mineral-rich waters from the far away mountains. It also pushed its own goods further down the river, sending bronze bracelets, iron implements, polished stone adzes, and beads of precious stones/gold. The settlement was also able to obtain rarer materials such as jade to make jewelry for its upper class, as seen in their burials. Like in other places in modern Thailand, Indian Kendi-ware pitchers were found at the site, indicating that some of this trade may have made its way to the Ganges delta and beyond, and returned with travelers, merchants, and missionaries."
# Sab Champa
sab_champa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sirindhorn Champi Flower"
sab_champa_heritage_desc:0 "Notable as the unique and seemingly only location of the native Sirindhorn Champi flower, a unique type of magnolia, Sab Champa has a long history stretching back to the early 1st millennium BCE and was one of the settlements to welcome and embrace a large Buddhist community of travelers and scholars alike. The local flowers fed off the river-plains environment and made the area a peaceful paradise for such peaceful visitors as the monks."
# Pong Manao
pong_manao_heritage:0 "Heritage of Pong Manao"
pong_manao_heritage_desc:0 "Burials at the Pong Manao site have been found dated as early as the early 1st millennium BCE, dating to the late Bang Chiang Period. It was built around a local hilly area that protected it both from natural and man-made dangers, from flash-flooding to raiding. Burials were found with burnished red ware, bronze anklets, necklaces of carnelian, and beads of glass and agate. Local iron deposits allowed the construction of iron tools and weapons to help defend the well-fortified area from incursions."
# Kualadungun
kualadungun_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kuala Dungun"
kualadungun_heritage_desc:0 "Settled and having territories near and along the coast, Kuala Dungun benefited from trade that came down the Mae Nam river and connected with the greater Maritime Silk Road between Chinese and Indian markets. Local iron deposits allowed for the production of heavy metal objects and tools/weapons which would serve the settlement and their neighboring trade. Besides metallurgy, the people turned to agriculturalism and fishing."
# Petchabun
petchabun_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Diamond Mountain"
petchabun_heritage_desc:0 "Found in a fertile and mineral-rich area, Phetchabun has served as the seat of power for several polities. It is associated with the symbol of a diamond which represents the riches (including gold, silver, and other metals) found within the Phetchabun mountain range. The area is also home to the rare freshwater jellyfish, which makes this wealthy land a hazard to people who would reap its benefits."
# Phu Lon
phu_lon_heritage:0 "Heritage of Thattaradtha"
phu_lon_heritage_desc:0 "A precursor to a major Dvaravati city, Phu Lon is said in the wondrous Phra Lak Phra Lam, a Laotian Epic, to have been founded by the ancient prince called Thattaradtha after he had left the legendary Lao kingdom of Muon Inthapatha Maha Nakhone, where he had been denied the throne. While his original city had been on the western bank of the Mekong river, a Naga with seven heads emerged from the water to convince him to create a sister city on the right bank, which could be connected with the site of Phu Lon."
# Xiangkhoang
xiangkhoang_heritage:0 "Heritage of Giant Jars"
xiangkhoang_heritage_desc:0 "These people have lived along the Xiangkhoang Plateau, traversing the so-called 'Plain of Jars,' since the 2nd millennium BCE. Because their land was open and without a great many mountains or other natural obstacles, much trade passed through their borders and into the southern Chinese areas. The landscape is so strangely named for the great clusters of stone jars found in deposits along its stretches, which may have served as holding containers for goods ready to transport or be picked up, or held safely until trade would begin. Some legends say a race of giants walked the plateau, ruled by a large king named Khun Cheung - the jars were his creations, used to hold alcohol (rice wine) for his ultimate celebration."
# Non Nok That
non_nok_that_heritage:0 "Heritage of Non Nok Tha"
non_nok_that_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited since the Bronze Age, Non Nok Tha, meaning “Partridge Mound,” was a plentiful agricultural society, growing rice paddies, bananas, cotton, mulberry, jute, and the like in their well-watered and irrigated fields. The people here practiced human sacrifice at times, leaving skulls as votive gifts in burials and shrines to the gods. A wealthy and religiously fervent people, one would consider crossing them with much reserve and caution."
# Ban Chiang
ban_chiang_heritage:0 "Heritage of Little Crucibles"
ban_chiang_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited as early as the Neolithic period, the people of Ban Chiang favored red-on-buff pottery during the Hellenistic period and manufactured their own metal tools in crucibles. They had equal amounts of bronze anklets as they did bronze spear-heads, prepared for trade and war equally. Yet, unlike many urbanized centers that produced metals in factory-like settings, the small villages around Ban Chiang, having no great centralized state, each forged their own local copper alloys and such without the concentrated expertise a city would afford - quite an achievement."
# Ban Lum Khao
ban_lum_khao_heritage:0 "Heritage of Harsh Equalilty"
ban_lum_khao_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited since the later half of the 2nd millennium, Ban Lum Khao, located on the Khorat Plateau, showed how the harsh and jungle-ridden environment could affect the ancient peoples of Southeast Asia. The men and women both had their hardships, eating different diets, having altered statures and deteriorating teeth, and might have been seen by some Mediterranean city-dwellers as a strange being of another species. Yet, with its unique aspects of male vs. female living, the society of Ban Lum Khao was rather egalitarian in nature, where all members had to stick together to make each village succeed. Both male and female burials bore exquisite beads and bone-wares, so it seems the men and women shared the consequences and benefits of life more equally than most."
# Snay
snay_heritage:0 "Iron-Armed Heritage"
snay_heritage_desc:0 "An Iron Age settlement, Phum Snay thrived during the later half of the 1st millennium BCE. It held within its borders a very warlike people, each person going to the grave with a weapon or two to protect them in the life beyond - swords, daggers, and projectile devices. Each implement of war was iron-wrought with bronze adornment. Shoulder-decorations, akin to pauldrons, complemented these tools of violence within the warrior society."
# Loeu
loeu_heritage:0 "Temple-Builder Heritage"
loeu_heritage_desc:0 "A deeply pious country, many deities, new and old, have their temples set up on hills, in valleys, on in the tightest of corners. Like with other Southeast Asian settlements, Indian traders, merchants, and missionaries came here as well, creating the beginnings of a Shaivist cultic practice."
# Phnom
phnom_heritage:0 "Heritage of Lady Penh"
phnom_heritage_desc:0 "Located in roughly the same spot as the capital of modern Cambodia, the name of the Phnom center of Vyadhapura betrays the influence Indian migration and traders had on the development of the area, bringing both Hinduism and Buddhism to the lands. The settlement, as told in legend, was created by a local woman named Penh, sometimes referred to as Daun Penh (Lady Penh), which seems to indicate a princess or some form of soft royalty taking up the local throne just as happened in many other local foundation myths throughout western Southeast Asia. Surrounded by branches of a river, the land around the city is fertile, a reliable flood-plain, which sustains the many inhabitants."

### Southeast Asian TI Heritages
# Daze
daze_heritage:0 "Daze Heritage"
daze_heritage_desc:0 "Mentioned in the Chu poem “The Great Summons,” the Xianbei people, who are a branch of the Donghu group, were best known for their horse-riders in the eastern steppe within inner and outer modern Mongolia. They were feared for their skill in mounted archery. Those of Daze live on the steppe around modern Hulun Lake (one of the five largest freshwater lakes in the entire region), and were able to supply themselves off of the wealth of fish, shrimp, and sell the pearls that could be found. The surrounding wetlands and the closeby Amur river provide a lush environment that stands out in the colder and dryer steppe."
# Nanhe
nanhe_heritage:0 "Nanhe Heritage"
nanhe_heritage_desc:0 "The Shiwei people of Nanhe were of Xianbei stock. The “Verses of Chu” and other Chinese literature describes them as one among several groups of barbarians. Their ornate art consisted of steppe-related natural imagery, such as crouching or geometric animals. Horses can appear in golden leaf headdresses or other majestic pieces meant for ritual wearing. While they spoke a Mongolic or pre-Mongolic language, Turkic influence was present, hinting at the future of the region."
# Donghu
donghu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Five Barbarians"
donghu_heritage_desc:0 "First recorded in the 7th century BCE, the Donghu originated in Heibei, modern Inner Mongolia, but split off into several subgroups as they migrated south over the centuries. The craftsmen of their tribes were renowned for their ability to make things such as bows, carts, and other tools and vessels without the years of specialization that masters in the settled lands of Chu, Wei, or Qin required to match such artistry. The Donghu, sometimes known only as the Hu, upon breaking into five groups as tribes migrate and split off, were known as the Five Hu, or the Five Barbarians. King Wuling of Zhao had his military adopt Hu clothes and cavalry techniques, seeing the danger of their seasonal harassments and valuing the advantage of their techniques."
# Sushen
sushen_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Black Dragon"
sushen_heritage_desc:0 "With their capital in a place meaning 'blackwater,' the Sushen people have strong ties to the Amur river, known as the 'Black Dragon River.' Possibly speaking a form of Tungusic, they have been mentioned in the “Classic of Mountains and Sea” as a northeastern tribe in the frozen lands or upper steppe near the taiga regions. Stories tell how they lived equally in caves and in trees, hunting with the most basic wooden and flint tools. They paid their tribute to the southern Chinese in bundles of arrows."
# Funie
funie_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Second Sun"
funie_heritage_desc:0 "Living around the freshwater lake called Khanka/Xingkai, some say that the people of Funie were subject to witnessing a strange, large, and bright object which resembled a great pearl hovering over the lake now and then in the dead of night, like a new sun shining over that one area - at random it would shoot up into the air like a star, its brightness choked out by the black night. This wonder eclipsed the beauty and richness of the fish and other creatures which could be found in the lake's waters. Many refer to those living here as the Yilou, who live among forested mountains and hilltops. They were valuable to outsiders because their lands birthed red jade and quality sable-skins, and they were feared because their arrows were dipped in poisons."
# Yulou
yulou_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Blackwater Mohe"
yulou_heritage_desc:0 "The Yulou, one of the Heishui Mohe tribes, lived along the Suifun River. Their tribal group's name comes from the meaning of a 'Black River.' Migrating along the river, the cold coast, and the hinterland forests, the Yulou have access to imports from northern Japan and are able to control the flow of hardwood and metal goods leaving for the Sea of Japan."
# Haoshi
haoshi_heritage:0 "Heritage of Yuexi Mohe"
haoshi_heritage_desc:0 "The Haoshi, also known as the Yuexi (not to be confused with the ravaging Yuezhi), settled around the Ussuri River and its expectedly devastated flooding. Sharing Lake Khanka with the Funie peoples, they witnessed the great pearl in the sky as well - it did not appear to have as great an impression on their more skeptical minds."
# Fuyu
fuyu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the White-Robed Dongming"
fuyu_heritage_desc:0 "Those of Fuyu belonged to the Tungus branch of the Altaic peoples and are mentioned in the Huozhi Liezhuan chapter on profiteering in the Shiji history. The Fuyu trace their legendary heritage to the ancient Dongming of the nation called Suli, having previously been northern barbarians and having become eastern barbarians. They worked the fields and as much as they bred and rode their horses. Their king and tribal leader ruled over a council of people known by their animal - the cattle tribe, the pig tribe, the horse tribe, and so on. The men and women wore white clothes each day, and, when a husband died, his unwed younger brother would marry the widow. In war, they believed the hooves of an ox could predict the future."
# Baishan
baishan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the White Peak"
baishan_heritage_desc:0 "Known as the people of the White Mountain, on account of nearby Paektu Mountain, those in Baishan look down over their southern centralized neighbors, protected in the frigid heights. While the Paektu creates an environmental phenomenon for the occupants with the crater lake called “Heaven Lake” and fertile volcanic soil, it's also given a mystical quality, believed to be a homeland by peoples in the greater Korean areas. These people belonged to the greater Sushen group of taiga-dwellers, being used to the rugged lands up north."
# Anchegu
anchegu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Tieli Tribe"
anchegu_heritage_desc:0 "Known among their Mohe-group neighbors as the Tieli, the Anchegu peoples resided along the river Songhwa. Like their neighbors, they heavily farmed those lands deemed arable while simply surviving in those other spots often frozen and uninhabitable. Speaking an early Tungusic language, they shared a culture with villages and tribes stretching far north and east up to the Sea of Okhotsk."
# Boduo
boduo_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Boduo Bu"
boduo_heritage_desc:0 "A tribe of the Mohe north of the Sumo Mohe, the Boduo people found safety by the bank of the Lalin River, where clean, fresh water and some midday meals could be found. Along the river, they were well practiced in farming and horticulture, growing wheat, millet, and the precious soybean. While doing so, they wore wolfskin coats and warded off any destructive animals."
# Sumo
sumo_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sumo Mohe"
sumo_heritage_desc:0 "Known as the Sumo Mohe, the Sumo tribe belonged to a branch of the greater Mohe peoples. They took their name from the Songhua River which was and remains one of the major rivers of all China. The Sumo, also called the Sumo Bu, were known to wear coats of pig and/or dog skin, standing out among their nieghbors and foreigners in a most grotesque way. Being mainly sedentary, they also practiced pig farming and consumed great quantities of pork."
# Huifa
huifa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mountain Shamans"
huifa_heritage_desc:0 "A tribe steeped in shaman culture and having attunement with the natural and supernatural order, the Huifa. Some say they worshiped a “Wood Lord” who watched them among the mountain forests, where divine songs would summon exotic beasts, incense would cause the birds to dance, and the beat of ceremonial drums would bring out the gods to appear in the sky. The area, now known as Jilin, was always rich in minerals and precious metals including gold, silver, gypsum, and iron."
# Joseon
joseon_heritage:0 "Heritage of God-King Dangun"
joseon_heritage_desc:0 "Legend tells how Gojoseon was founded by the god-king Dangun - son of the god-prince Hwanung and the bear-woman Ungnyeo - as far back as 2333 BCE. In the 12th century, stories also tell how a sage named Jizi/Gija of the Shang dynasty came to this spot after a period of wandering and became the great founder Gija Joseon. The lineage of these great founders is said to trace back to the Baekdu Mountain, the White-Tipped Mountain, where the Lord of Heaven brought Hwanung into the world. The settlement grew over time, made rich by the wealth it accrued in trading wares both north-south and east-west. The text called “The Growth of Yan,” written after the Yan people had explored the regions around them, alludes to as much, and further texts illuminate how Joseon grew into a powerful kingdom that was able to wage war against the Yan in the 4th century BCE, having grown as a city-state and engulfed its neighbors to become vassals and integral parts of its territory."
# Woju
woju_heritage:0 "Woju Heritage"
woju_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited by the Okjeo Korean people, Woju served as a balance in the scale which weighed the power of the Chinese against that of the large tribes such as the Goguryeo. Yet, while it was always being courted and influenced by the more centralized kingdoms and tribes, it retained its own native customs and governance strongly with its people keeping to their smaller villages and settlements on the seashore, having a hereditary chief in each village, cultivating the five grains which their fertile lands grow plenty of. Their spears defend their sandy beaches from foreign invaders while their few horses and oxen work the fields and their children prepare for perfectly-catered arranged-marriages."
# Dongwei
dongwei_heritage:0 "Dongwei Heritage"
dongwei_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Dongwei, also sometimes known as the Dongye, or Eastern Ye, maintained close cultural connections to the neighboring Goguryeo tribes, sharing their ethnic customs and language with those peoples and the Okjeo tribes. Known to the Chinese as one of the many 'eastern barbarians,' they are recorded as having practiced a festival called “Mucheon,” worshiping the heavens and the gods in them until the 10th month of the year - this may be connected with the Dongmaeng festival held in the Goguryeo lands at the same time. Both festivals held marital significance and display, with the Tiger god as the iconic deity praised during this period. To fund such festivities, the Dongwei farmed the normal grains as well as silkworms and hemp."
# Soknobulsa
soknobulsa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Militarized Border"
soknobulsa_heritage_desc:0 "Lying along the Han river, the only physical barrier between itself and the large kingdom of Joseon, Soknobulsa (also known as Songnobulsa) acted as a defendable buffer state as a subject of the Jin confederacy. Thus, it was always prepared for warfare and was protected by its overlord as the premier battlefield, should the north and south of the Korean peninsula collide."
# Musu
musu_heritage:0 "Musu Heritage"
musu_heritage_desc:0 "Also known at times as Mosuguk, Musu had a population of Mahan Korean people. The farmland around this place is the largest in the surrounding region, offering it an advantage in the ability to feed a large army - thus, it was a wonderfully valuable vassal to the Jin confederacy, acting as a base and a pit stop for armies traveling north to the border with Joseon."
# Gori
gori_heritage:0 "Gori Heritage"
gori_heritage_desc:0 "Known best for their long-lasting and pristinely-built temples, the people of Gori found solace in faith and ritual worship. Their temples complemented their local architecture and would be valued by their conquerors and rivals, not to be razed like normal cities and their structures."
# Jingug
jingug_heritage:0 "Jingug Heritage"
jingug_heritage_desc:0 "The State of Jin, otherwise known as the Jin Confederacy, controlled a large group of city-states and smaller groups in the southern Korean lands and came into being as early as the 4th century BCE. Although its structure of governance was quite complex, managing so many vassals and subject territories, it was still able to have a strong foreign presence, sending out many ambassadors and messengers to far-off courts in order to contend in the greater Korean political arena. To fuel their growing and centralizing population, they imported metal components and ores from the Chinese frequently. They also held several cultural ties to people on the isles of Japan, crafting similar tools and weapons as the Japanese Yayoi people and possibly speaking, in some areas, a Japonic language before the cementing of a Korean linguistic continuum in the area."
# Damna
damna_heritage:0 "Heritage of a Mystical Box"
damna_heritage_desc:0 "Sometimes known as the barbarian island, Damna, modern Jeju, was a temperate but majestic home for its people, with basalt cliffs and a volcanic origin. Damn/Tamna is said to have been settled by three divine founders, those being Go, Yang, and Bu, who each emerged from holes in the ground some time in the 24th century BCE - the current inhabitants still protect and venerate the supposed holes, perhaps awaiting the emergence of new divines. Other stories speak of a strange box which washed up onto the shorelines one day, inside of which were three women, cows, horses, and seeds for sowing. The people of Damna traded both with the Chinese to the west and the Korean peoples on the mainland to the north."
# Gijeo
gijeo_heritage:0 "Gijeo Heritage"
gijeo_heritage_desc:0 "Feeding off the Nakdong River, the people of Gijeo were of Jinhan stock but made local traditions and festivals very important to their unique culture and livelihood. They held a tradition of mask-wearing and ritual meats/dishes, but their society became more muddled with the introduction of more consolidated norms imposed by the Jin rulers of the Jin confederacy which puppeted Gijeo."
# Siljig
siljig_heritage:0 "Heritage of Wet Canola Flowers"
siljig_heritage_desc:0 "Set among the rocky eastern shore of the Korean peninsula, the people of Siljig have long had a strong connection with the ocean - their imports come through it, their exports leave through it, and traveling along it proves easier than along the mountain and hillside paths. They came to celebrate the sea and worship it, every spring wading into the waters and pushing out small boats filled with beautiful canola flowers and cherry blossoms into the grip of the waves. This small and peaceful procession, as well as its isolated society, could only be interrupted by the marching armies of the southern city-states like Saro, who viewed all of Jinhan Korea as their domain to control."
# Uyu
uyu_heritage:0 "Heritage of Snow Crabs"
uyu_heritage_desc:0 "Known for its wealth of snow crabs (which thrive in the cooler subtropical climate), Uyu, also written as U-yu, was home to one of the northern groups of the Jinhan tribes. The tribes-folk may have even worshiped the large invertebrates in relation to divines - perhaps specifically to a sea god, or something much more exotic."
# Somun
somun_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sunset Trees"
somun_heritage_desc:0 "The land of the Somun people was best known by fond memories, memories of jubilant times colored in flairs of red and yellow. Many trees existed in this place, giving it a mystical, even magical quality. When the spring came, yellow flowers bloomed brightly and the red fruit, dyed and even darker red as part of a ritual act, contrasted with those blooms to create a vibrant, sunset landscape the whole day over. The only threat to this blissful peace was the aggressive stance of Somun's neighbors, such as the power-hungry nobility within the city-state of Saro."
# Yeodam
yeodam_heritage:0 "Heritage of Flying Spirits"
yeodam_heritage_desc:0 "Subjected to a subtropical humid climate, the people of Yeodam belonged to the more regional Byeonhan tribes who had local traditions such as burying feathers in burial pottery so that the deceased might be able to fly into the heavens once they reached the afterlife.

# Geungi

geungi_heritage_desc:0 "First inhabited in the second half of the 2nd millennium, Geun-Gi started as a place for prosperous fishing villages, where the waters offered safety from the rather harsh, hot summers in the area.

# Gulbal
gulbal_heritage:0 "Gulbal Heritage"
gulbal_heritage_desc:0 "Also referred to by outsiders as Golbeo I Soguk, Gulbal was a small area on the east-west road heading towards the kingdom of Jingug. A rebellious people, the inhabitants of Gulbal frequently revolted against whoever the regional hegemon happened to be, yet the results of those rebellions were not always positive. Eventually, they learned to cooperate with semi-regional powers and prosper off the trade of allies such as other Jinhan city-states."
# Ballo
ballo_heritage:0 "Heritage of Oriental Melons"
ballo_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Ballo subsist off of the many fruits and vegetables  and grains their home provides, but the most notable of these is the oriental melon, which grows plentifully in the humid continental climate - a juicy treat for any social class.

# Dongno
dongno_heritage:0 "Dongno Heritage"
dongno_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Dongno have lived on their island homes since the Neolithic Period, and when the kingdom of Dongno/Dokro came to be, it was split into two halves, administratively. Even though they were mainly islanders, the people of this kingdom shared ties with the great Byeonhan peoples of the Korean southlands who sent trade goods down the rivers, through the deltas, and past the ports of Dongno islands. Thus, trade was their bread and butter, making them also politically relevant, as they had a say in which ships could safely transport goods over their waters."
# Gojamidong
gojamidong_heritage:0 "Heritage of Paleontologists"
gojamidong_heritage_desc:0 "Besides having a robust naval industry, the people of Gojamidong were a curious lot, quick to learn, and even interested in studying their own past.

yiqu_heritage_desc:0 "Settled around the late eighth century BCE, the state of Yiqu was made of people who far predated its settled existence - the Yiqu were a people long-lived as an 'other' right on the border of the Han Chinese, north of the Jing River. With the other Rong-culture groups in the central valley attacked, assimilated, or vassalized by the expansionist Qin state over the centuries, Yiqu was a remaining bastion poised as a thorn in the Qin side. Thus, the armies of Yiqu and Qin assaulted one another's cities, land was ceded back and forth, and the Yiqu state became a hated rival of Qin's king Zhao even at an early age, continuing the destructive rivalry."

zhongshan_heritage_desc:0 "First mentioned in 509 BCE, but founded long before that time by the Baidi people, the state of Zhongshan was the unlikeliest and spryest of the warring states in the central plains area. Noted as hostile by its large neighbors, Zhongshan held onto the warrior-culture it took from its tribal origins and used its galvanized and war-ready population to fiercely maintain the state's boundaries. When invaded by Wei armies, the nobles of Zhongshang kidnapped the invading general's son and sent him as a stew to the boy's own father.

The written records of the city-dwellers claim that the Ba people trace the creation of their state back to Lord Lin, who brought together the five major clans, and a contest was held to determine the groups central chief.

As members of the fork of the Southern Silk Road, the Sui clans had control over the flow of goods south to Burma, west to the Tibetan heights, and north to the Taklamakan Desert where the Jade trade begins.

qiongdu_heritage_desc:0 "Known only as barbarians, an unlearned and impossible-to-teach folk, the Qiongdu tribes were a footnote in the records of the settled Chinese empires, a mere nuisance on the fringes beyond official borders. North of the kingdom of Dian, barbarians in the eyes of some themselves, the Qiongdu were notable for their appearance, often observed with their hair worn in a mallet-shaped fashion. Unlike their mobile neighbors to the north and west, the Qiongdu tribes were dominantly settled and lived off the bounty of what land there was to till."

# Xi

The so-called Ailao Mountains in this area were rich in minerals, rare metals, and raw materials that supplied the tribes. The trade-tax and caravan trade that brought were simply bonuses for the Ailao clans which brought rare goods into their possession now and then."

# Yelang

yelang_heritage_desc:0 "First recorded in the 3rd century BCE, the polity of Yelang was shaped by flexible borders with its semi-pastoral and mobile neighboring tribes. The people there referred to themselves as Zina, and so they came to be known by that name, and all the people to their east and north and the greater area came to be known by a similar name. While the Yelang were still tribes folk, they were largely a confederation of settled agricultural groups, simply separated from one another by the difficult geography. Yet, despite their separation and sedentary lives, when challenged by overwhelming odds the people of Yelang banded together in formidable armies which warded off many invasions over the centuries."

# Juding

# Luowo
luowo_heritage:0 "Heritage of Petty Rivalry"
luowo_heritage_desc:0 "Bitter rivals of the kingdom of Yelang, the rulers of Louwo often raised armies to send against them. It was futile and often equal warfare, and the soldiers became tired of the generations of fueding. It is said that, when commanded to once again raid an enemy town, the Louwo general carved wodden statues of the opposite general and his staff, shooting the wooden effigies with arrows instead of the men themselves. Eventually, the Louwo and Yelang hawkish members resorted to spymastery and assassination to accomplish their goals. Yet, the two continued on, alive, as is, without end. Only a greater political power would have a chance to end their squabbling."

# Qielan
qielan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Zangke"
qielan_heritage_desc:0 "Often a subordinate kingdom or polity to the throne of Yelang, the Qieland people lived in the area known as Zangke, named for a boat (the name means strong and made of wood), but also for the stake used to tie boats together. The Qielan people were both tied to their neighbors, like the Yelang, but were also their own boat, strong and sailing on a wooden frame made from their tough, native trees. The Zangke River took Qieland traders to other lands where goods could be exchanged for needed supplies or desired luxuries such as silk, so 'Zangke' also represented the socio-economic lifeline of the kingdom of Qielan."

# Bie

# Xiou
xiou_heritage:0 "Xiou Heritage"
xiou_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Xiou, also known as the folk of Western Ou, have long been locked in the trappings of the southern Chinese jungle, close but never reaching the wealth of the coast to their south. On account of their disadvantageous geography and lack of manpower and wealth, they were often bullied by and at the mercy of more centralized and powerful groups, such as the successive kingdoms of the Nanyue people. For this reason, their history has more often been one of subjugation and not one of conquest."

# Gui

gui_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Gui, a Tai-branch, settled this warmer and richer region along the riverbank where fewer competition could be found. It is true that the jungles along the river cause all manner of trouble, but it is a peaceful place that runs along the artery of a trading network into the dense hinterlands. Boats carrying logs of timber could be seen daily floating down the watercourse and the caverns within the nearby hills could house raiders and pirates of all manner who could leech off the trade lane."

# Lac Viet
lac_viet_heritage:0 "The Red River Heritage"
lac_viet_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabiting the Red River Delta as early as 700 BCE, the Lac Viet people would sound their bronze drums out all listeners along the riverbed into the middle of the night. Legend tells how they once lived in a kingdom called Van Lang, where Lac princes, lords, and even kings held power over the people in an early feudal-style system. While they were not the most advanced people, one may have considered them more fair, for the women among the Lac Viet held a high status and were well-respected."

yueshang_heritage_desc:0 "The Dong Son people of Yueshang, brothers and sisters to the Lac Viet groups inhabiting the Red River Delta, have been around since at least 1,000 BCE. Skilled rice cultivators and animal herdsmen, the people of Yueshang had full bellies and much raw material to trade along the coastal roads. They, also being bronze-castors, were famed for the bronze drums found in their burials - they made these using a lost-wax casting process borrowed from the Chinese to the far north. It is said that their rulers, the descendants of the semi-legendary Hung Kings, trace their lineage all the way back to the ancient and godly Lac Long Quan and his fairy consort Au Co - the people of Yueshang were thus half dragon and half fairy."

# Lamap

lamap_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Lamap congregated in what is possibly the oldest village in all of the Vietnamese area, Tuong Lam. Its people belonged to the Sa Huynh culture which had existed since at least 1,000 BCE. The Sa Huynh worked in iron craftsmanship while their northern neighbors focused on bronze smithing. Their iron goods would then sail out into the Pacific Ocean, headed toward markets south along the mainland coast, the western ports of Taiwan, and the far-off trade hubs of the Philippines. This way, the people of Lamap were well-connected with the Asutronesian speaking islanders, the capital of Tuong Lam became a cosmopolitan hub."

# Xitu
xitu_heritage:0 "Xitu Heritage"
xitu_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Xitu were a mix of Linyi locals, island traders from the western reaches, and the inland Cham people who were rapidly advancing in Viet society on the coasts. The Cham, a mix of Malay, inlander, and Austronesian/Polynesian stock, gave greater sense of mercantilism to the ports of Xitu, and thus trade and the economy of each coastal village bloomed. Zircon, gold, agate, carnelian, and a load of other precious minerals and gems flowed from the islands to the west and could be sold further inland or north to the greater Yue tribes and kingdoms."

# Cangwu
cangwu_heritage:0 "Cangwu Heritage"
cangwu_heritage_desc:0 "Just south of the great Chu empire, the Cangwu tribal kingdom and its people was seen by its northern neighbor as a stubborn border buffer, a thorn in the side of the Chu which would one day be removed. Many greater powers in the region have long had eyes on turning Cangwu into a commandery for their southern-facing forces, as the prize of the valuable southern coast and its rich cities could be found just beyond the jungle, and the Cangwu region was an impressible fortifiable and impassable place which could be defended with ease from outside invasion. Among the dense brush and the general wilderness, the people of Cangwu built temples with an eye towards the heavens, from which they observed the signs found among the stars and predicted future events by the twinkling of those divine lights."

# Yangyue
yangyue_heritage:0 "Southern Yue Heritage"
yangyue_heritage_desc:0 "One of the many southern Yue peoples hugging the shore, the Yangyue were first described during the Warring States period, having split off from the main Yue kingdom after its defeat long ago. Far to the south, the Yangyue and Baiyue people thrived on the commercial ventures which the South China Sea offered. However, because of their growing fortune, they were constantly being eyed by the Central Plains empires, who saw the greater group of Yangyue and Nanyue peoples as a prime vassal to take in order to both secure southern borders but also a consistent maritime trade route spanning the entire coastline east to south of the mainland."

# Yangyu

All Miao people were said to have descended from the legendary Jiuli tribe, but they were defeated by Yu the Great in battles and were thus dispersed by the encroaching Yue peoples. The rest were subjugated by the Chinese of the Central Plains region. Yangyu, practically a Chu puppet, remains as the last glimpse of Miao independence and greatness."

# Fulou
fulou_heritage:0 "Heritage of Watery Pearls"
fulou_heritage_desc:0 "With its capital of Fanyu situated on the eastern bank of the Pearl River, the people of Fulou were guaranteed a rich legacy in trade and commerce. Its port controlled all trade and shipping into and out of the river and its bay and was the prime location to filter all the goods which could disperse into the hinterlands or leave for island markets. The people of Fanyu belonged to the greater Southern Yue group, but the city they prospered in had its origins as far back as 1,100 BCE. From a military standpoint, this place was also the best vantage point and staging ground from which to guard the southern coastline and also to plan its conquest."

fengbitou_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Heavenly Mountain"
fengbitou_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabited by the ancient Paiwan people who oftentimes held close to the cliffs and mountains, the site of Fengbitou was characterized for a unique red cord-marked pottery schema.

# Tahu

tahu_heritage_desc:0 "Home to the ancient Siraya people and their predecessors, Tahu sat on the great stretch of fertile plains which dominate the western half of the Taiwanese isle. It is from their Austronesian language which the modern term Taiwan comes from. They were thus a more sedentary people, focused on farming and fully utilizing the bounty of the land while also manning the shores and the commercial ports. In their society, the labor is divided up between the men and women in the manner where women were responsible for the farming and religious activities while men were responsible for hunting, warfare, and governance."

# Daqiuyuan

daqiuyuan_heritage_desc:0 "The mountainous ridgeline-type lands which the site of Daqiuyuan was built on were the typical home of the Tsou and other ancient Austronesian mountain-tribes. The Tsou told themselves stories in oral renditions of how their clans crossed the mountains as unique and separate tribes before congregating and forming a group identity by which they came to refer to themselves. Looking down on the plains-dwellers and the ports far below, the Tsou are far away from the commercial sea action, and yet they are one of the few peoples can know the best routes to transport goods swiftly across the spine of the island, from one side to the other, skipping the journey sailing all the way around."

# Fanzaiyuan
fanzaiyuan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Rebellious Sea People"
fanzaiyuan_heritage_desc:0 "Home to the ancient Taokas tribes, the area around Fanzaiyuan was surprisingly fertile and useful for a settled population, straddling the northwestern and southwestern plains regions of the Isle of Taiwan. While the Taokas tribes were often peaceful inhabitants, dedicating their lives to the sea through fishing, commercial maritime trade, and worship of sea-deities, they had their violent side. The Taokas peoples were famous for their rebellious tendencies and their willingness to overthrow any rule they deemed oppressive."

# Shihsanhang
shihsanhang_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sanasay Monster"
shihsanhang_heritage_desc:0 "Home to the ancient Katagalan tribes, the site of Shihsanhang and the northern Taiwanese plains region were not the first choice of home for the tribal folk. It is said that they actually lived on a different island previously, called Sanasay, which they left out of fear. On Sanasay, a monster had appeared which terrorized the villages of the people, and even wounding it with traps and trickery could not bring salvation and peace to the island. One day it came to the village and ate a child in its hungry rage, so the villagers declared their intention to leave and sailed far off the shores of Sanasay, finally arriving near the Shuang-Xi river in the northern plains of Taiwan, where they settled and split off into several groups."

# Hanben
hanben_heritage:0 "Flatland Sailor Heritage"
hanben_heritage_desc:0 "The ancient Kavalan people called this area home, living both high in the hills and mountains while also taking advantage of the lower plains areas along the coast. Their legends say that they sailed to the Taiwanese island from the east, catching a glimpse of its beautiful shores and setting their claim to the land as soon as they had landed. There were 36 main tribes to the group, with many more lost or uncounted over the ages. Because of the flat and paradisiac beaches they came to inhabit, they came to be called the people of the flatlands."

# Huagangshan

huagangshan_heritage_desc:0 "The mountain, hill, and jungle-dwelling Atayal tribes live in and around Huagangshan and its environs. It is said in legends that their people came from a single and mysterious stone. This stone, called Pinspkan, cracked and produced three beings - one returned to the stone and its realm, while a man and woman remained in this world and bonded in their love of one another. While the boy was too shy to be with the woman intimately, she darkened her face and tricked him into believing she was a stranger, with whom he had no qualms being intimate around for lack of familiarity and nervousness. Thus, the pair created all of the Atayal people, born of the stone, and elders of each tribe pay homage to the shrewd girl when they mark their faces with dark tattoos."

# Pinglin

pinglin_heritage_desc:0 "The ancient Sakizaya people called this eastern region of the Taiwanese island home, yet they appear to have appeared on different parts of the shoreline as early as the Neolithic period. They subsited off of maritime trade and marine life, and they held a close relationship with the peoples on the Penghu archipelago, for they shared the same stone adzes for breaking up the soil of the land when they attempted farming. Besides the  bountiful and mysterious sea, the Sakizaya people worshiped their own ancestors and the women of the tribes led both faith rituals and political matters."

# Jiuxianlan
jiuxianlan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Rukai"
jiuxianlan_heritage_desc:0 "Known in some circles as the Tsarisen or the Tsalisen, the ancient Rukai tribes inhabited the area around Jiuxianlan alongside pockets of the Amis tribes. The Rukai were best known as highland-dwellers who thrived among the rugged landscapes of the eastern half and central spine of the Taiwanese island. They shared many characteristics with their Paiwan neighbors to the south, but were notable for their ceremonial dress attire, which included elaborate headwear/head scarves as much as it did precious jewelry. Many of the precious gems and their collection came from foreign trade, with a specific regular import of goods from the Philippine Jade culture to the south across the sea."

Green Nephrite artifacts have been found littering the coasts of both island regions and shipwrecks in between, and the jade trade during the Classical and Hellenistic period in this area was likely the single largest sea-based trade network for a geologic material. One of the common luxury items made from the Nephrite was a green ear pendant likely worn by prestigious elders and leaders among different tribes and confederations. As the largest pit-stop in between these two jade sources and markets, Anaro was an unavoidable market and collection point which basked in the shining green wealth."

# Liukiu
liukiu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Shell Barbarians"
liukiu_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabiting the modern Ryuku islands, the people of the Liukiu villages and lords lived in severe isolation from the rest of the peoples within sailing distance. Having originated predominantly from Jomon sailors and traders, the remained a cultural isolate as the world evolved around them. Left in mystery, they were characterized as having no hierarchy, living in a society where the men pluck all the hair from their bodies and the women tattoo their hands in the image of insects. Many Doulou trees populate the islands, resembling oranges dense in foliage. They mainly fished, only cultivating some rice where convenient. The shell was their national object, used to create their homes, their weapons, and their burials. Their shell-warriors were a fearsome and confusing site."

# Nagsabaran
nagsabaran_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Pig People"
nagsabaran_heritage_desc:0 "The people of Nagsabaran settled in the area thousands of years ago and were notable for the large quantity of bovines which they held in close company. Many tribes on the northern Luzon island of the archipelago differed in their preference for pig consumption or pig sacrificial worship, but the pig was clearly an important part of daily life for them one way or another. Their caretaking of pigs goes back to the Neolithic period, where the oldest burial site bones have been dated to, and thus the pig must have taken on an important symbology for many tribes early on."

# Tabuk
tabuk_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Botak Tattoo"
tabuk_heritage_desc:0 "The Kalinga tribes settled in the Tabuk area ages ago. Sustaining themselves on the abundance of rice paddies in the area and the practice of swidden farming, the Kalinga folk also benefited from the rich mineral and precious metal deposits in cliff and hillsides in the area. Members of their tribes practice the art of Batok tattooing, putting animalistic patterns across large portions of the human body. They were firm in their religious beliefs and were convinced that their divine creator had once lived among them, motivating them in their daily lives alongside the spirits of ancestors."

# Ifugao
ifugao_heritage:0 "Heritage of Rice Terraces"
ifugao_heritage_desc:0 "The Ifugao people themselves were known as the earth-people or hill-people on account of their insistence on farming and sustaining themselves along hillsides and rich rice paddies. They maintained an epic oral tradition based on a mountain-dwelling hero and the grain cultivation of their ancestors. Feasting was a common practice amongst the tribal folk and they believed in prestige and glory connected with the presence of ancestor spirits."

# Tondo
tondo_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Datus"
tondo_heritage_desc:0 "Situated on the Pasig River delta on the Luzon island of the archipelago, the port of Tondo controlled a strategic part of maritime activity in the region. The size and control of the port and its subsidiary settlements almost ensured a monopoly on the trade between the Pacific islands and the Chinese city states and empires. The cities and villages under the overlordship of Tondo were ruled by local Datus, who reported to the most senior leader in Tondo itself. Besides trade goods, the port of Tondo also imported many foreigners, from other Austronesian settlers and traders to Indian and/or Buddhist monks and travelers from far away."

# Bisaya
bisaya_heritage:0 "Impressionable Islander Heritage"
bisaya_heritage_desc:0 "Spread out over stretches of the more southern islands within the Philippine archipelago, the Bisaya tribes, sometimes known as the Visaya, relied heavily on maritime sustenance and commercial activities to maintain their culture, communication, and way of life. While they held very clear animistic-polytheistic beliefs, they were a very impressionable people, and the many cultures they traded with could impart some part of their culture and faith on the islanders."

# Tagbanwa
tagbanwa_heritage:0 "Tagbanwa Heritage"
tagbanwa_heritage_desc:0 "One of the oldest peoples in the Philippines, the Tagbanwa were noted by travelers for their appearance. They were said to be brown-skinned, skinny, and straight-haired. They maintained constant maritime and political contact with ports and tribal groups and trading partners around the area of modern Brunei, taking part in the web of trading networks outside the Jade Trade. They fashioned ceremonial and traditional garb out of tree bark, specifically the inner layer of the bark, which was beaten with a mallet and molded."

# Lamuri
lamuri_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Indianized Minangkabau"
lamuri_heritage_desc:0 "The ports of the Lamuri kingdom were the closest to the Indian subcontinent, of all the Sumatran kingdoms, and so it was the most Indianized areas of Sumatra and the Indonesian archipelago at large. It was also a large traveling port for Buddhist missionaries. Its ports acted as a filter for Indian and Bangli goods headed for the Pacific islands, and so it bore some of the greatest and most exquisite riches of the Indian lands, as well as rare spices and commodities."

# Barus
barus_heritage:0 "Heritage of Spring Waters"
barus_heritage_desc:0 "The port of Barus was well-loved by travelers and merchants because it was situated near wellsprings and fresh water was widely available to the thirsty who came into the harbor. Of all the items a trader could purchase at the port, the most unique and memorable was camphor. It was easily harvested from the nearby forests, appearing similar to modern plastics. What kept sailors inside the safety of the port were the frequently violent storms which racked the waves offshore."

# Aru
aru_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Karo People"
aru_heritage_desc:0 "The Karo peoples who populated the tribal kingdom of Aru were originally limited to the inland higher altitudes before traveling down to the shore and establishing the first ports in the area. On the way to the famously profitable Malacca Strait, the shoreline of Aru was quite defensible and could offer protection as much as a threat to all commercial ships traveling from Indian and Bangli lands with rich commodities."

# Panai
panai_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Malaccan Emporium"
panai_heritage_desc:0 "Passed by on the way to the Malacca Strait, the port city of Panai was always busy with travelers and merchants heading both east and west. Buddhist monks were particularly fond visitors. The Visaya tribes in the Philippines held that their neighbors on the surrounding islands had actually come from this place - the truth of the matter is unknowable, but it reveals the close cultural and economic link which Panai held between the Pacific islands and the Indian Ocean."

# Kandis
kandis_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Oldest Sumatrans"
kandis_heritage_desc:0 "The oldest political state in ancient Sumatra, the kingdom of Kandis, also just known as Kandis, controlled a great stretch of the eastern and western coast of the island. The kingdom, the largest of the Minangkabau people, also partook in a large amount of trade with the Javanese peoples to the east, the Malay cities and ports to the north/northwest, and the Indian markets far to the west."

### The Northern Forest-Steppe TI Heritages
# Skirithfinia
skirithfinia_heritage:0 "Sapmi Heritage"
skirithfinia_heritage_desc:0 "Having developed iron production around 500 BCE, the Finns of the Hellenistic period exported furs, slaves, wood-wares, and birds of prey into the European heartland as well as across the Baltic Sea, where they also began spreading both their culture and language. The inhabitants of southern Finland may also have been an ancient branch of the Sami people, best known for herding reindeer in a semi-nomadic capacity."

# Karbonia
karbonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Stone Ships"
karbonia_heritage_desc:0 "The ancient peoples of Estonia first and foremost found their power and their connection with the rest of the world in the Baltic Sea, first building great fortresses and walled settlements on their northern island holdings. This allowed them to purchase and trade Scandian bronzes while exporting their own irons smelted from lake and marsh-ores. Like stepping stones, their cist-shape graves dotted the landscape, with some burial sites along the coast even resembling the shape of early naval vessels. Their ambitions lie among the frigid waves."

# Ossia
ossia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ossi"
ossia_heritage_desc:0 "Inhabiting the shore of the river Daugava, which separated the Fenni peoples from the Balto-Slavs to the south, the Ossi tribes were both blessed and cursed by their ease of access to the Baltic Sea. While the politically powerful among them gained great wealth from controlling the flow of Scandian/Germanic goods heading inland and vice versa, Scandinavian pirates and raids frequented the river and often molested their shores."

# Careotia
careotia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Fenni Mystics"
careotia_heritage_desc:0 "The Careoti tribes benefited greatly from controlling both banks of the river Volkhov and the lake Ilmen. Both names, taken from Finnic roots, refer to magicians, magic, and an airy nature, giving the sense of the mystical aura this landscape held in the hand of the Fenni mystics and their sacred rituals in groves and by the waters. Beyond legendary stories, this river and lake combination gave the Careoti control over a wealthy trading lane from the Finno-Scandian markets and the heartland Baltic territories. They had the ability to control the flow of goods and tax the fur and metal trades in the region."

# Androphagia
androphagia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Man-Eaters"
androphagia_heritage_desc:0 "A confusing people whose language confused all who did not speak it natively, the Androphagi were said to be the only one of those tribes in and around Scythia where ritual cannibalism was a regular practice. Those barbarous men and women ate their fellow folk with sides of furry creatures. Having no strong ties with the Royal Scythians or any other of the Scythian tribes—this was shown when they refused to aid the Scythians against the invasion of Darius—they remain aloof and untrustworthy, the material of nightmares."

# Salia
salia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Moskvites"
salia_heritage_desc:0 "The early Meryans called this place home, the border between the forest-steppe and the deeper northern forest. Lying along the Moskva river, the Salii tribes rely on the fertile lands for sustenance and the forests for animals with furs and meat. Less powerful than some of their more aggressive neighbors, they were, at times, forced to pay tribute to overlords."

# Pagyritia
pagyritia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mordvins"
pagyritia_heritage_desc:0 "Tall in nature, most having dark hair and blue eyes, the Mordvins held a penchant for embroidery and bright hair dressing—they also loved bronze jewelry. They derived their livelihood from the strong Rha river, now known as the Volga. Set between the feared Androphagi and the frail Mari, they existed as one of the greatest branches of the greater Volga community of Finnic speakers."

# Boruscia
boruscia_heritage:0 "Mortal Heritage"
boruscia_heritage_desc:0 "Calling the Volga and Kama rivers their home, the Mari people of the Borusci tribes are the most ‘mortal’ or peoples. They saw their home, the overwhelming natural world, as a source of eternal and unwavering good. Their faith in their environment bound the tribes together, and the people considered themselves synonymous with their faith—the two were intrinsically intertwined. Perhaps this may be a consequence of their long-past origin in the frozen Siberian reaches, where life alone was death and the presence of green nature was minimal to none."

# Argippaeia
argippaeia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Sacred Tree-Dwellers"
argippaeia_heritage_desc:0 "Found in the rich lowlands outside of the Ural Mountains, the Argippaeans were a bald people from birth, having flat noses and long chins—their physical form was alien to any citizen of the Aegean region. Eating the fruit of the Ponticum tree, they lived in quiet solemnity. The fruit itself of the Ponticum was known to their tribes as the ‘aschy.’ They drank its juice with milk and made cakes from its lees, for meaty animals are hard to come by. They were perceived as a sacred people and, for each member of the tribe, a tree was their home, clothed in thick felt."

# Arimphaeia
arimphaeia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Berry-Bellies"
arimphaeia_heritage_desc:0 "Blessed by the gods, the Armphaeians dwelt among the cold, northern forests and lived on sweet berries. Not unlike the famed Hyperboreans in the far north, they were a mystery to all but the most experienced travelers and traders. Mild in manner, they were also mild in hair styles, all men and women wearing it short. They lived unmolested by their savage neighbors and practiced their rituals in peace."

# Pormania
pormania_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Urals"
pormania_heritage_desc:0 "Having spoken the Permic languages, the Pormanians were children of the Ural Mountains, relying on its heights and dangerous spine as a measure of safety against foreign incursion. However, besides being known for their well-forested home, the Pormani were known as rich traders, with 'perm'possibly referring to merchant/market. Their mountainous region was rich in natural resources which could be exported, via the highway-like steppe, to far away buyers."

# Sabiria
sabiria_heritage:0 "Sabiri Heritage"
sabiria_heritage_desc:0 "A multicultural people, the Sabirii tribes collectively took influence from other Finno-Uralic peoples such as the Sargat-type Arimaspii and the Permii. Having benefited from the Central Asian trade systems, their burials were filled with gold, silver, jewels, and decorative works. They were so well-connected in the Eurasian trade web that they even possessed wares of Egyptian and Sri Lankan design. Far in the north, their kind was likely unknown to the workshops which created these goods—they would have been well within the realm of myth, far off the believable horizon."

# Nascia
nascia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Magyars"
nascia_heritage_desc:0 "Having originally come from the deeper reaches of Western Siberia, the Magyar Nascii tribes were multicultural in that they held contact between Iranian, Turkic, and Slavic peoples as well as their own Finno-Ugric familial tribes. They oriented their dead northwards and, like other Ugric peoples, they had geometric clay vessels in their burials. They took part in the massive and continuing waves of westward migrations along the steppe and forest-steppe zones."

# Arimaspia
arimaspia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Wise Thieves"
arimaspia_heritage_desc:0 "Rivals of the gold-guarding griffins, the Arimaspians were a mystical one-eyed tribe. Chronicled only by a few travelers such as the legendary Aristeas, they were known in their lands as wise thieves who coveted the gold their neighbors held dear. They knew how to navigate the wild caves of Boreas and were sought out for prophecies and mystical advice. Beyond their mystical nature, they had wisdom in metallurgy—their settlements produced famed malleable iron and steel."

# Issedones
issedones_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Issedones"
issedones_heritage_desc:0 "Similar to, yet distinct from, the known Scythian tribes of the Pontic and Caspian Steppe, the Issedones were only observed through rumors and whispers—tales of the poet Aristeas or anecdotes from adventurous Syrian merchants who traveled the foundations of the so-called 'Silk Road.' Unlike their neighbors, they wear their hair long. They held the practice of polyandry and only cannibalized the deceased elderly of the noble class as a form of worship."

# Korgantas
korgantas_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Beheaders"
korgantas_heritage_desc:0 "Their burials were decorated with the heads of domesticated animals. Lacking the large dromoi of their predecessors, the Korgantas peoples left many questions and few answers with their passing. Their arrows had heads of bone and they struck fear into the hearts of their enemies, preparing Central Asia for the endless waves of terrifying Turkic migrations to come."

# Bugu
bugu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Mother Deer"
bugu_heritage_desc:0 "Worshiping the Mother Deer, the Bugu tribes dwelt by Lake Balkhash and, before that, the river Yenisei in deep Siberia. Over the ages, they have mixed with Iranian, Uralic, and Turkic peoples, collecting a wide belief and cultural system with which to run their society. They frequently warred with and raided the settlements of their neighbors, ravaging villages and hamlets in a semi-nomadic capacity in order to sustain their warbands. The horse was their weapon of choice."

# Gryphia
gryphia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Griffins Guarding Gold"
gryphia_heritage_desc:0 "These people—if they can even be called people—lie well beyond the boundaries of ordinary knowledge and comfortability, even history. Their nearest neighbors, the Arimaspii, are themselves hard to believe on account of their one-eyed nature. These far off lands, the stories say, are home to griffins guarding hoards of gold (gold which others covet). In reality, the griffin acted as a symbol of awe or fear, and indicated an ability beyond mortal power. Perhaps the tribes folk of these cold and unforgiving lands held a power which they lorded over their surrounding neighbors, creating a memory of awe and fear of their might?"

### Japanese TI Heritages
# Jomon (CULTURE GROUP)
jomon_heritage:0 "Jomon Heritage"
jomon_heritage_desc:0 "Named for the cord-marked pottery they were famous for, the Jomon people inhabited much of Hokkaido, Honshu, and the Kuril and Ryuku islands before the northward crawl of the Yayoi tribes. They made much jewlery from bones, antlers, shells, and stones and were comparable to pre-Columbian North America in their habits. A metalworking people, the Jomon were sources of much of Japanese mythology and origin studies, being a diversified group with its fingers in every rich region. While not fully-fledged farmers, they were known for domesticating varieties of peaches and practiced several other forms of arboriculture."

# Yayoi (CULTURE GROUP)
yayoi_heritage:0 "Yayoi Heritage"
yayoi_heritage_desc:0 "Tracing their lineage back to the Neolithic Period, the Yayoi peoples were best known for, in contrast to the Jomon, their intensive rice agriculture in paddy fields. They were less isolationist, and therefore imported technologies of metallurgy and bronze-making from China as well as its sense of hierarchical social classes. Their willingess to take influnce from the Chinese came from the reality that many of them were Korean farmers who had migrated eastwards onto Japanese soil and had taken their mercantile, social, religious, and political connections with them. In Japan, they stratified their societies and created complex and intricate bronze objects such as ceremonial bells, mirrors, and weapons of war. They were taller, stronger, and looked down on the Jomon people to the north."

# Nivkhgu
nivkhgu_heritage:0 "Heritage of Bear-Rearers"
nivkhgu_heritage_desc:0 "Hunters, fishermen, and dog breeders, the Nivkh people were at home in the frigid taiga environment of Outer Manchuria and Norhtern Sakhalin Island. Large villages were rare among their kind and the clan-based groupings they did live by were family-based, with interwoven marriages holding them together. Due to their low-density spread across the taiga, the bride-price was high among their people, and only the wealthiest of men could have one or even more wives. They committed bear sacrifice to show the gods their piety after capturing the cubs and raising them for years as children."

# Susuya
susuya_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sakhalin"
susuya_heritage_desc:0 "Living on the island of the Black River, the Susuya people were an offshoot of the Nivkh hunter-gatherers of Siberia and Outer Manchuria. Unlike their mainland cousins, the Susuya people traded heavily with the Jomon people of northern Japan, evidenced by their Epi-Jomon string and comb-impression pottery of the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. They hunted sea creatures for food and kept many dogs, which they also ate when hard times arose."

# Ebetsu
ebetsu_heritage:0 "Heritage of Humorous Animals"
ebetsu_heritage_desc:0 "Named after the 'humor' river, known for its murky color, the Ainu group in and around Ebetsu held the closest connection to their Nivkh-branch northern neighbors on Sakhalin island. They were harbingers of the Epi-Jomon (or Zoku-Jomon) period, where stone technology and cord-marked ceramics remained a staple of life while they seperately broke traditional patterns of mmobility and sedentary subsistence agriculture. They were so close to the natural world that their epic traditions, the Yukar, reflected 1st-person narratives from the point of view of animals such as owls, foxes, and the like - the sounds of their oration mimicking the noises of natural creatures."

# Kitami
kitami_heritage:0 "Birthplace of Scallop Farming Heritage"
kitami_heritage_desc:0 "The people of this tribe are concentrated in the rich zones between the Kitami mountains and the Sea of Okhotsk. Thus, their access to the waves is great and their fisheries flourish, especially those harvesting scallops. The Ainu peoples' belief in animal spirits and physically inhabiting the world around them led to a great era of peace between their fellow Ainu. The people of Kitami prospered during this time, before the conquests of the Yayoi Japanese from the south. Their trade with the other Jomon and Yayoi people to the south, on the Honshu island, held risks of violence, unfair exchanges, and the unknown. This uneasy feeling was represented through their Epic tale of 'The Wolf God who Saved Pon Otasutunkur and his Son,' where marriage and trade with the Wajin (Japanese) to the south leads to bloodshed and thievery which a wolf god, an image of the natural world, must save the Ainu heroes from."

# Esan
esan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Shallow Fort Trade"
esan_heritage_desc:0 "Centered on their 'hak-casi' ('shallow fort') on the Oshima Peninsula, the Ainu people of Esan traded closely with and were simultaneously the most threatened by the Japanese to the south. Their Yukar Epic narratives involving the Wajin ('Japanese') to the south, either those settled on the tip of Southern Hokkaido or Northern Honshu, explain the relationship between both peoples as having started off friendly before the Wajin aimed to control both the means of trade and rule the Ainu through it. Clearly, the Ainu of Esan had learned to become defensive in their economic efforts. In their 'casi' on the Oshima Peninsula, the multiple kotan (settlements) outside of the foritifed settlements would be debated in a carange, or debate. Those who willingly gave the Wajin power through trade may have been banished from their kotan and had their Achilles tendon severed as punishment."

# Tusima
tusima_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Japanese Gateway"
tusima_heritage_desc:0 "The inhabitants of Tusima, modern Tsushima, live within a wild place - an archipelago which loosely comes together in the form of a solitary island. This stretch of beaches and lofty heights acts as both a conduit and a barrier of trade, culture, faith, politics, and war between those on the Korean peninsula and others on the main Japanese islands. In its peaceful moments, the people of Tusima play with the Yoshino cherries growing along the hilltops or stalk the Tsushima Leopard Cat, hoping to make a pet out of it. The island was supposedly one of the original 8 created by the Shinto gods Izanagi and Izanami and was inhabited by Jomon Japanese and Korean settlers in the Neolithic Period or earlier. It was noted as one of the 30 union countries, Yamatai, which ruled the region during the 1st millenium BCE, trading with the Yayoi in Japan proper and the Jinhan in Korea."

ingala_mod:0 "Ingala Valley"
ingala_mod_desc:0 "The Ingala Valley has supported large populations in this portion of the forest-steppe since at least the Early Bronze Age, and with the expansion of the Sargat culture into the former lands of Gorokhovo, the Sargat have inherited the capital of the Eastern Urals and have used the bountiful resources and wetlands to thrive and project influence throughout Scytho-Siberia."

rice_terrace_mod:0 "Rice Terraces"
rice_terrace_mod_desc:0 "For thousands of years, the ancestors of the modern Ifugao people have cultivated the mountains and valleys of the Philippine Cordillera. While the antiquity of the famous terraces is still debated (with some researchers claiming their date back over 2,000 years), there is no doubt that the people here grew rice, taro and other crops since Austronesians arrived about 4,000 years ago. The ability to produce crops at such high altitudes and marginal environments through masterful agro-engineering skills ensures food stability and abundance in the region."

chinese_tiger_mod:0 "Chinese Tigers"
chinese_tiger_mod_desc:0 "The Chinese Tiger is among the most iconic beasts to roam the wilds of the world, striking awe and fear into those who come across it. Tigers feature heavily in Chinese religious and cultural beliefs, while Chinese Tiger skins and bones have been prized trade goods since time immemorial. Pet tigers were also revered in the courts of China and the southern tribes, being traded live as cubs to the royalty and nobility of Asia."

white_tiger_mod:0 "White Tigers"
white_tiger_mod_desc:0 "The spectacular White Bengal Tigers of central India, found especially from the area around Ambaloda, are a rare and beautiful specimen. The animal sells for staggering amounts of gold to all the kings and nobility of India, both alive and or dead. These rare white tigers are a variation of the orange Bengal Tiger, with the white color deriving from a recessive gene."

ebony_mod:0 "Forests of Ebony"
ebony_mod_desc:0 "Since the times of the early pharaohs of Egypt, ebony wood has been a treasured trade item from vast forests of the Sudan and Aethiopeia. This precious dark black hard wood was valued as jewelry, for making furniture and other ornaments. The ancient Egyptians also used the hard black wood to inscribe heiroglyphs, some dating to over five thousands years ago."

xishi_mod:0 "Temple of the Beauty Xi Shi"
xishi_mod_desc:0 "The legendary Xi Shi, the first beauty of China, was born in Zhuji and lived in the early 5th century BC. Xi Shi's beauty was said to be so extreme that while leaning over a balcony to look at the fish in the pond, the fish would be so dazzled that they forgot to swim and sank below the surface. She was discovered by minister Fan Li of the Yue kingdom and gifted to the rival Wu Kingdom. He became hypnotized by her and built a large temple for her and other beauties. Little did King Fuchai of Wu know that minister Fan Li plotted with the beauty Xi Shi in one of history's first recorded sexpionage operations - Xi Shi successfully seduced the king, convinced him to kill his advisors and greatest general, and ignore state affairs, leading to the downfall of the kingdom shortly thereafter. Xi Shi's stunning beauty has inspired songs and stories for millenia since."
