 embellish_suebi_grave_fields_desc:0 "Many dead warriors were put to rest in the graves of #Y Laciburaium#!, their families laid next to them, and their spirits were released to the afterlife in elaborate cremation ceremonies. They all served us well, all in their own way. Their final resting places have been abandoned for decades and are now in a deplorable state. \nTheir released spirits may look down upon us benevolently from the afterlife - if we embellish and restore their graves. The dead deserve remembrance for the deeds they accomplished."

 chaukia_terp_desc:0 "The conditions of building a terp in [GetProvince('(int32)3836').GetName] based on the Frisians' example are ideal. This will give our people more land to live on, as it is an artificial dwelling mound that is created to provide safe ground during storm surges, high tides and sea or river flooding."
