 zhuzibaijia_rujia:0 "Confucianism"
 zhuzibaijia_rujia_desc:0 "Confucianism is a school of thought that believes in the doctrine of Confucius, the core of which is benevolence. Mencius, a representative figure of Confucianism in the early Qin Dynasty, developed the doctrine of Confucius and advocated benevolent government. The Confucian doctrine founded by Confucius formed a complete ideological system based on the summary, generalization and inheritance of the traditional culture of the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, which respected relatives."
 zhuzibaijia_fajia:0 "Legalism"
 zhuzibaijia_fajia_desc:0 "Legalism is a school of thought in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period of China that focuses on the rule of law. This school of thought rejected the hierarchical system inherited from the hereditary nobility and believed that 'if a sage can strengthen a country, he should not follow his own rules, and if he can benefit the people, he should not follow his own rites.' In their political practice, they rewarded farming and warfare, emphasized agriculture and suppressed commerce, destroyed poetry and books, completely broke with traditional culture, and advocated the rule of law. The doctrine of Legalism was a purely utilitarian system of thought, and its core content was mainly directed at how the monarch could strengthen his rule. In the Warring States period, when 'don't give courtesy but war, abandon benevolence and righteousness but use deceit, if only to get strong', this kind of thinking of Legalism was indeed quite practical in the struggle."
 zhuzibaijia_mojia:0 "Mohism"
 zhuzibaijia_mojia_desc:0 "The Mozi school was one of the major philosophical schools in China during the pre-Qin period, with a strict discipline and a leader known as ‘Kui Zi’. Members of the Mozi family were required to implement Mozi's ideas as officials in various countries, and they were also required to follow the orders of the ‘Kui Zi’. Mozi studied under Confucianism in his early years, but later abandoned Confucianism and created Mozi. Therefore, although most of the Mozi's ideas were opposed to Confucianism, they were also influenced by Confucianism. The ten major ideas of Mozi are ‘concurrent love’, ‘non-attack’, ‘virtuousness’, ‘common sense’, ‘heavenly ambition’, and ‘the will of the gods’. ‘Heaven's Will’, ‘Ming Ghost’, ‘Non-life’, ‘Non-Love’, ‘ Save burial’ and ‘Save use’."
 zhuzibaijia_daojia:0 "Taoism"
 zhuzibaijia_daojia_desc:0 "Taoism, one of the Hundred Schools of Thought. During the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, Laozi gathered the wisdom of the ancient sages and formed a complete and systematic theory of Taoism, marking the formal formation of Taoist thought. Taoism, with 'Tao' as its core, believes in the inaction of the Great Way, advocates the natural method of Tao, and proposes such political, economic, governance and military strategies as the creation of the Law of Tao, the use of female to guard the male, and the parallelism of rigidity and flexibility. It is one of the most important philosophical schools among the 'Hundred Schools of Thought' and is found in all areas of Chinese culture. It believes that 'Tao follows nature', that 'Tao' follows all things, respects all differences in the world, and assists in the full development of all differences. Therefore, there is no unified form of Tao, nor is there a unified way to approach Tao, which delegates power to human beings and allows them to become their own masters."
