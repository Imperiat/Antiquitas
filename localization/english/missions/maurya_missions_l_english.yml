#Flavor Events
flavor_maurya_1_title:"Death of Chandragupta" 
flavor_maurya_1_desc:0 "Our pious Raja, Chandragupta, has fully embraced the teachings of Jainism, choosing to starve his earthly body to death so that his soul might blossom. Many within the court are still shocked, and some are calling for a long period of mourning before settling the succession. However, our many enemies will take note and we must act quickly; Bindusara, eldest son of Chandragupta, will be the new Raja."
flavor_maurya_1.a:0 "May he rest easy."

flavor_maurya_2_title:"Bhadrabahu the Jain" 
flavor_maurya_2_desc:0 "Our illustrious court attracts many traveling holy men; some seek to proselytize, sharing the teachings of their Masters in hopes of gaining new followers, and many simply ask for alms before passing through to the next city. But today is different; a Jain monk named Bhadrabahu, known throughout the land for his many writings, has arrived in our palace and King Chandragupta has shown much interest in him. Perhaps his teachings could help us in our strive to greatness?"
flavor_maurya_2.a:0 "Bring him into court"
flavor_maurya_2.b:0 "Maurya is not Jain!"

flavor_maurya_3_title:"Jain Teachings" 
flavor_maurya_3_desc:0 "Bhadrabahu, the Jain monk that recently joined our court, has been teaching every morning. Even Chandragupta himself ventures down into the courtyard after sunrise, taking a seat amongst the listeners, and the conversations between Monk and Raja lasts for many hours, often past the midday meal. Many are starting to believe that Jain ways of thinking are worth considering. If we were to preach them throughout our kingdom, perhaps we could profit from it somehow."
flavor_maurya_3.a:0 "Begin to embrace Jain values in the realm"
flavor_maurya_3.b:0 "Maurya is and always will be Hindu!"
flavor_maurya_3.tt:0 "Bhadrabahu will leave and head south..."

flavor_maurya_5_title:"The death of Bindusara" 
flavor_maurya_5_desc:0 "In a terrible chain of events our Raja, Bindusara, Devourer of Enemies, has been murdered. Shortly after this dreadful news was made known, many of his sons engaged in a bloody battle over the throne, during which his son Ashoka proved victorious. However, while we may still have a raja, trouble is brewing within our realm. The recent deaths of Chandragupta and Bindusara have left their marks on our kingdom, and difficult times will lie ahead."
flavor_maurya_5.a:0 "Ashoka will fix this chaos."
flavor_maurya_5_tooltip:0 "#G Gain access to the Collapse Prevention mission tree#!. \n#R This mission tree will be failed if it is not completed before the death of Ashoka#!."

flavor_maurya_6_title:"Ashoka is Dead!" 
flavor_maurya_6.desc_1:0 "Ashoka the Great has died and so will we. Without his guiding hand leading us, how can we hope to survive? Many countries on our borders and even our own subjects are now looking to bring our once great empire to an end. Is our last hope of survival truly gone?"
flavor_maurya_6.desc_2:0 "Ashoka the Great has died, but his efforts were not in vain. He stabilized our country and the Mauryans rule over all of India. He shall be known as the greatest Indian ruler to have ever lived for many years to come. His accomplishments shall echo through eternity!"
flavor_maurya_6.a:0 "Trouble approaches..."

flavor_maurya_9_title:"Deccan Disunity" 
flavor_maurya_9_desc:0 "My Lord, our empire lies in ruin. All of our holdings in South India have revolted. The Satavahana dynasty and the Kalingas, may dogs chew on their bones, have declared themselves independent, with many more seemingly on the way to do the same! What can be done?"
flavor_maurya_9.a:0 "When will it end..."
flavor_maurya_9.b:0 "Maybe this is a new beginning."
flavor_maurya_9_tooltip_B:0 "#Y Satavahana#! and #Y Kalinga#! will either declare war or offer us a truce."
flavor_maurya_9_tooltip_C:0 "Abandon #Y Maurya#! and continue to play as #Y Satavahana#! and fight a war against #Y Maurya#!."

flavor_maurya_10_title:"The matter of Satavahana" 
flavor_maurya_10_desc:0 "Sensing our disunity, the leaders of Satavahana have decided that the time has come to rebel against us. There is no easy way to state this, my Lord, but much of central India is lost. However, if we were to strike quickly, we might be able to squash this rebellion and secure the region. Nonetheless, more trouble seems to be on the way. Perhaps it would be smarter to let them have their independence for now and strike them at a later point?"
flavor_maurya_10.a:0 "Let them be...for now"
flavor_maurya_10.b:0 "We must regain these territories!"

flavor_maurya_11_title:"Dealing with Kalinga" 
flavor_maurya_11_desc:0 "In the southeast of our empire, the faraway province of Kalinga has declared their independence from us. The local nobility has made a show of publicly renouncing their support for us and have started an all out rebellion, expelling our garrisons from their cities - this treachery will not be tolerated. However, similar events are happening all throughout our realm, and Kalinga might not be the most important fire to put out. Leaving them in a false sense of security could ease a later reconquest."
flavor_maurya_11.a:0 "Establish a truce"
flavor_maurya_11.b:0 "Kalinga is detrimental to Maurya!"

flavor_maurya_12_title:"Indo-Greek Coalition" 
flavor_maurya_12_desc:0 "For years, Greek rebels have schemed in northwest India to gain independence, but we have never considered these meddling foreigners to be more than an annoyance. But now, the cursed Greeks have organized themselves into a great coalition against Mauryan rule, and have even convinced some of the local populace to join them! What shall we do to deal with this emerging threat?"
flavor_maurya_12.a:0 "Declare war on these rebels"
flavor_maurya_12.b:0 "We cannot afford another costly war"
flavor_maurya_12.c:0 "Play as Kapisa"
flavor_maurya_12.d:0 "Play as Panchanada"
flavor_maurya_12.e:0 "Play as Kuninda"
flavor_maurya_12.f:0 "Play as Kashmir"
flavor_maurya_12.g:0 "Play as Sauvira"
flavor_maurya_12_tooltip_A:0 "Abandon #Y Maurya#! and continue to play as the #Y Indo-Greek Kingdom#! of #Y $indo_greek_revolt_one_name$#!."
flavor_maurya_12_tooltip_B:0 "Abandon #Y Maurya#! and continue to play as the #Y Indo-Greek Kingdom#! of #Y $indo_greek_revolt_two_name$#!."
flavor_maurya_12_tooltip_C:0 "Abandon #Y Maurya#! and continue to play as the #Y Indo-Greek Kingdom#! of #Y $indo_greek_revolt_three_name$#!."

flavor_maurya_12_tooltip_E:0 "Abandon #Y Maurya#! and continue to play as the #Y Indo-Greek Kingdom#! of #Y $indo_greek_revolt_five_name$#!."

flavor_maurya_13_title:"Shunga Rebellion" 
flavor_maurya_13_desc:0 "The letter arrived late in an evening, brought by a messenger who collapsed from exhaustion in your palace after delivering it. When you first opened it to read the contents, your hand trembled by the second paragraph and you dropped it to the ground. Not believing your own eyes, in a faltering voice you command an advisor to read it aloud. The blood is pounding in your ears with each word; your friend Pushyamitra Shunga, one of our highest-ranking military officers, has backstabbed the Mauryan kingdom with an act of treason. He dares to proclaim himself Raja of all of northern India and has started a rebellion against us. But what is worse is that much of our army has already deserted over to him! We are literally surrounded by enemies who seek our doom. Truly, this couldn't have come at a worse time for us."
flavor_maurya_13.a:0 "This is the end..."
flavor_maurya_13.b:0 "A new way forward, as Shunga, would be wise..."
flavor_maurya_13_tooltip:0 "#G Gain access to the Mauryan Revival mission tree#!"
flavor_maurya_13_A_tooltip:0 "Abandon #Y Maurya#!, continue to play as #Y Shunga#! and fight the imperial challenge war!"

flavor_maurya_14_title:0 "The death of Susima"
flavor_maurya_14_desc:0 "Our primary heir, Susima Maurya, has mysteriously died. The palace guards have found the young prince dead in his chambers this morning, and our best healers were unable to do anything for him. Investigations are already being conducted, with the screams of interrogated prisoners echoing throughout your palace at all hours, but no one seems to have seen or heard anything. The sudden murder of our prince is truly disturbing, and more and more rumors about discontent governors and nobility are slowly spreading throughout the court. It seems as if times of change lie before us, whether we want them or not."
flavor_maurya_14.a:0 "Bonk!"

flavor_maurya_17_title:0 "Indo-Greek Ways"
flavor_maurya_17_desc:0 "The Mauryan kingdom was too far in decline to be repaired, despite the efforts of many to claim the mantle for themselves. Instead of trying to reforge what should remain broken, we have decided to create a new kingdom, one that embraces the cultures of the many peoples that live under our banner; we shall not attempt to piece together the shattered legitimacy of the Maurya, but shall create an Indo-Greek dynasty of our own that will become more powerful than any that have preceded us."
flavor_maurya_17.a:0 "Kapisa is now our home"
flavor_maurya_17.b:0 "Panchanada is now our home"
flavor_maurya_17.c:0 "Kuninda is now our home"
flavor_maurya_17.d:0 "Kashmir is now our home"
flavor_maurya_17.e:0 "Sauvira is now our home"

flavor_maurya_18_title:0 "The Shungan Ways"
flavor_maurya_18_desc:0 "Wise men and philosophers argue that all life is sacred and must be valued, but when the rule of a wicked Raja brings untold misery to the countless souls they are responsible for, it becomes a sacred duty to kill the offender and return balance to creation. Could a truly just man tolerate such an affront to gods and men without being called to action? Our founder, Pushyamitra Shunga, found himself in this unenviable position, but chose the path of wisdom and liberated us all from the tyranny that was destroying us. As the decadent Maurya are punished for their sinful ways, the House of Shunga will seize all authority and create a mighty kingdom of our own."
flavor_maurya_18.a:0 "The Shunga Dynasty will rule forever!"

flavor_maurya_19_title:0 "Satavahana"
flavor_maurya_19_desc:0 "The Mauryan Empire has crumbled and a new power rises in Central India; the Satavahana. Fearing our inevitable rise, our foes attack us on all sides, hoping to overwhelm us before we are able to establish ourselves, but our moment has arrived and we shall fight bitterly for mastery of the Deccan Plateau. Now is the time for war, but let it be known that the House of Satavahana shall usher forth a period of prosperity never before seen in all of India!"
flavor_maurya_19.a:0 "The Satavahana Dynasty will rule forever!"

me_maurya_collapse_1_title:0 "Ashoka the Terrible"
me_maurya_collapse_1_desc:0 "There are stories being told about the wrath of Ashoka; some believe them to be absolutely true, others false, but even those who scoff at the details do not dare to mock him openly. Our Raja has embraced debauchery; Ashoka gorges himself on delicacies, entire platters of roasted game and stuffed peafowls, but his terrible hunger is not satiated by meat alone. In his madness, it is said that he gives his ministers impossible requests, like chopping down every fruit-bearing tree in all of India, killing those who balk at his strange orders. Even his own concubines are not safe from his hand; just last month, he burned over five hundred to death."
me_maurya_collapse_1.a:0 "Despicable..."

me_maurya_collapse_2_title:0 "Ashoka the Great"
me_maurya_collapse_2_desc:0 "Ashoka, with the zeal of the newly converted, is doing everything within his power to pay off his karmic debt as he seeks to atone for his years of cruelty. Instead of diverting vast sums to feed his debaucherous appetites, the Raja is reinvesting in the welfare of his people with an unprecedented building campaign. Instead of hoarding his wealth, the common lands are fortified with wells and irrigation ditches, so that the people might grow nourishing food. Schools are being built for the training of healers, so that none might suffer needlessly. In his largesse, Ashoka does not limit these projects to his own core lands, but seeks to provide for everyone in his vast empire - we are truly fortunate to have such a doting Raja."
me_maurya_collapse_2.a:0 "Phenomenal!"

me_maurya_collapse_3_title:0 "Chandashoka"
me_maurya_collapse_3_desc:0 "The peasants are repeating a story that is so ludicrous that it might amuse, but we shall report it to you anyways. It is said that Ashoka, in his ever-growing zeal, has actually traveled to the underworld, in order that he might be instructed in the black arts of torture by demons! In order to utilize this dark knowledge, he has built an elaborate prison complex in Pataliputra which the locals have dubbed Ashoka's Hell, for once you descend into its bowels, the gods themselves cannot free you. Is it any wonder that the Raja is being called Chandasoka, Ashoka the Fierce?"
me_maurya_collapse_3.a:0 "Disgusting..."

me_maurya_collapse_4_title:0 "Kalingan Destruction"
me_maurya_collapse_4_desc:0 "Your blood-spattered weapon falls from your hand and you sink to your knees, temporarily overwhelmed by conflicting sensations. The fighting is finished, at last, but it came at a terrible price to the people of Kalinga. All around you, the bloodcurdling screams of wounded animals and men; a loud, sustained wailing that eerily drifts over the battlefield, mixing with the smoke from the burning fortifications. This pitiful sound pierces your soul - is that one of your soldiers that is dying? One of the enemies? Is not man a noble creature, who deserves to live a life free from the vicissitudes of fate? How is it that you, Ashoka the Great, are hesitating in this moment of triumph? Although it is strange to admit, you feel a sharp pang of regret for the devastation you have caused. Unbidden, a Buddhist precept comes to mind, which surprises you...true strength is found in compassion. You mouth the words silently, over and over again, as your victorious army gathers around you."
me_maurya_collapse_4.a:0 "I Have Had An Epiphany - Convert the Realm"
me_maurya_collapse_4.b:0 "Maurya is not Buddhist!"

me_maurya_collapse_5_title:0 "Samudra the Monk"
me_maurya_collapse_5_desc:0 "Your Majesty will not believe what they are talking about in the markets, but it is true, all true; I have verified with my own eyes. It seems that the son of a merchant, a Buddhist monk named Samudra, had been sentenced to death for his crimes. When the appointed hour had come, he was placed in the vat of boiling excrement, but - forgive me, My Lord, but I only repeat what is said - he caused a lotus flower to bloom from the filth, upon which he meditated peacefully. Unshaken by this miraculous display, our jailers tried to punish him, but Samudra preached...and somehow he escaped. But he did not run away! He went to the center of the city and began to levitate, with half of his body engulfed in flames and the other drenched in water. Samudra says he is no god, but follows the ways of the Buddha. Shall we summon this miracle worker to speak?"
me_maurya_collapse_5.a:0 "Bring him into court"
me_maurya_collapse_5.b:0 "Maurya is not Buddhist!"

me_maurya_collapse_6_title:0 "Collapse Prevented"
me_maurya_collapse_6_desc:0 "Thanks to the hard work of our indomitable King Ashoka, the collapse of the Mauryan Empire has been prevented. Portraying militaristic and administrative genius, Ashoka has proven himself as one of the greatest kings India has ever seen. Our perfidious governors no longer wish to betray us and our beloved people have regained their trust in us. Now, having resolved the issues within our realm and having saved our empire, we are once more free to look outward. Who knows what the future will bring for the Mauryan Empire?"
me_maurya_collapse_6.a:0 "Blessed be Ashoka"
