joseon_mission_tree: "Ancient Kingdom, New Home"
joseon_mission_tree_DESCRIPTION: "Nearly two thousand years ago, our mythical leader #E Dangun#!, the Grandson of Heaven, established his heirs as Kings of #E Joseon#!, and ever since that portentous moment, our people have struggled mightily against our neighbors to the west and north.\n\nRecent clashes with the #E Yan#! to our west have caused a change in our military thinking, and this, combined with the ever-present threat of tribal raids to our north and east, has created the impetus for Joseon to move southward. It will be a bloody path that we must carve, yet the future of our ancient kingdom relies on our ability to provide security in a world where none can be found."
joseon_mission_tree_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be considered complete when #E Joseon#! has expanded southward, conquering and assimilating the peoples of the Korean Peninsula."
joseon_mission_tree_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "The rich lands of the south call out to us - all we must do is claim them!"

#Missions

joseon_mission_tree_task_1: "A Defensible Capital"
joseon_mission_tree_task_1_DESC: "Our recent clashes with the #E Yan#! have made us question the wisdom of having our capital city so close to their borders. We should abandon the marshlands of #E Xiandu#! and move to the plains near #E Wanggeom#!, where it will be easier to defend our home. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil13!"

joseon_mission_tree_task_2: "Protection Against Yan"
joseon_mission_tree_task_2_DESC: "Our settlement at #E Tuhe#!, the capital of the disputed Liaoxi Province, is located directly across from the Yan's regional capital. As we foresee our wars against the Yan continuing, we must build a fortress close to our enemies. Demolish the old fortifications at #E Xiandu#! and rebuild near the border. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

joseon_mission_tree_task_3: "Patrolling the Borders"
joseon_mission_tree_task_3_DESC: "The #E Steppe Riders#! from the settled tribes to our north continuously move across the porous frontier, bypassing our humble defenses and launching raids as they please. Because building a line of fortifications will be outrageously expensive, we must step up our border patrols to prevent this from happening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil1!"

joseon_mission_tree_task_4: "The New Capital"
joseon_mission_tree_task_4_DESC: "We are settling into our new capital of #E Wanggeom#! nicely, although there remains much work to do when it comes to building up the local infrastructure.

joseon_mission_tree_task_6: "Wanggeom Harbor"
joseon_mission_tree_task_6_DESC: "Ideally situated on the banks of the #E Taedong River#!, #E Wanggeom#! has unfulfilled potential as a massive shipyard - a hub where both merchants and marines can dock their boats. Improving our naval capacities will benefit trade, as well as increase our military preparedness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil1!"

joseon_mission_tree_task_7: "Chinese Trade Connections"
joseon_mission_tree_task_7_DESC: "Our #E Chinese#! neighbors across the waters of the #E Bohai Sea#! would make excellent trading partners, and if we increase our economic cooperation, then we could perhaps increase our political connections - we would do well to make some friends in foreign lands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil8!"

joseon_mission_tree_task_8: "A Modernizing Influence"
joseon_mission_tree_task_8_DESC: "It is practically impossible to resist the influence of our #E Chinese#! friends to the south. As there are many things we can learn from them, we have decided to wholeheartedly embrace their culture. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil11!"

joseon_mission_tree_task_9_claims_tt: "We will receive claims on #Y Gaoyi#!, #Y Woju#! and #Y Dongwei#!."

joseon_mission_tree_task_10: "Southern Confederacies"
joseon_mission_tree_task_10_DESC: "Now that we have chastised the barbarous #Y Gaoyi#! people, we can turn our attention southward, to the confederated cities that owe their loyalties to #E Jingug#! - we shall smash any leagues, defensive or otherwise, that stand opposed to our designs! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil3!"
joseon_mission_tree_task_10_claims_tt: "We will receive claims on #Y Soknobulsa#!, #Y Baekje#!, #Y Musu#! and #Y Gori#!."

joseon_mission_tree_task_11: "Passage To The Jinghai Sea"

joseon_mission_tree_task_12: "The End"
joseon_mission_tree_task_12_DESC: "Now that the humble settlement of #E Moku#!, the laughable capital city of the #E Jingug#!, has fallen to our forces, our complete and total victory in the south is all but assured - the era of southern independence has come to an inglorious end. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil4!"

joseon_mission_tree_task_13: "The Beginning"
joseon_mission_tree_task_13_DESC: "Every end holds within it a beginning; the sun sets every day, yet each morning, the promise of dawn is renewed. Let us remember these wise teachings as we begin to construct a new kingdom, one that encompasses the entirety of the peninsula, with all of her disparate peoples.\n\nThe future of this land is entwined with the destiny of #E Joseon#!; no more shall they be separated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil15!"
joseon_mission_tree_task_13_reward_tt: "We will be able to pick a province to construct a #Y City#!."
joseon_mission_tree_task_13_reward_tt_2: "Every province in #Y South Mahan#!, #Y Byeonhan#!, and #Y Jinhan#! will receive the #Y Peace of Joseon#! modifier, which reduces local unrest and increases wrong culture happiness."

joseon_mission_tree_task_14: "Prosperous Hinterlands"
joseon_mission_tree_task_14_DESC: "The lands surrounding #E Wanggeom#! are blessed with all manner of natural resources - we are overwhelmed with the quality of the stone, the dyes, and even the amber that can be found in the mountains.

me_joseon_1_desc: "The omens have spoken, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and the message from Heaven is clear; if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] does not adapt to the changing times, then our ancient kingdom shall be utterly destroyed, without a single stone remaining on top of another.\n\nOur situation is precarious, but this does not mean that there are no options available to us. It will be a fine balancing act that our ruler [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] will be forced to walk, but the path ahead is clear.\n\nWe must do everything we can to protect our people from our #E Yan#! and #E Fuyu#! enemies while we establish ourselves farther to the south. The next few years promise to be perilous, but our ambitions are greater than our fear of what the future holds in store."

me_joseon_2_desc: "One does not need to be a village elder to remember the last time that the armies of the #E Yan#!, our hated neighbors to the west, brought their battering rams to the walls of #E Xiandu#!. Our proximity to their borders practically guarantees the prospect of protracted sieges in the near future.\n\n Although we have a long connection to our capital city in the marshlands, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has made the unpopular decision to abandon our ancient home to settle somewhere in the south."

me_joseon_3_title: "A Defensible Capital"

Over the last few months, our people have been setting their affairs in order, settling contracts and gathering their possessions, waiting for the order from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. We let another harvest season come and go, making sure that we were able to store as much food as possible, and then, finally, when we had enough rice saved to take us through the winter, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] gave us the order to travel south.\n\nAs the column of our citizens winds their way through the hills and plains, heading towards the #E Taedong River#!, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] can be found at the very front of the procession, offering words of encouragement to those around [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] ."

me_joseon_4_desc: "Because [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that we must build fortifications in [GetProvince('(int32)8773').GetName], the mournful decision to demolish our old citadel at #E Xiandu#! has been given.\n\nAlthough tears streamed down the faces of the workers as they began to tear down the walls that their ancestors erected, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was unmoved by their sorrow."

me_joseon_5_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have received word that construction in [GetProvince('(int32)8773').GetName] has finally been finished, something that our foes in #E Yan#! have noticed with great displeasure.

me_joseon_7_desc: "We are overwhelmed with joy this morning, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], with the news that [GetProvince('(int32)8801').GetName] is thriving. Although some believed that relocating our capital would be a disasterous decision, a harbinger of dark days to come, no one is able to voice these criticisms anymore.\n\nSimple stated, #E Wanggeom#! is the place to be these days - so many of our people have been abandoning their homesteads and settlements, hoping to build a new life for themselves in the capital."

There, while bleary-eyed shopkeepers set out their wares to the hungry cries of circling gulls, ships filled with trade goods from #E China#! and #E India#! arrive in our ports. Aromatic spices, like clove and cinnamon, waft through the marketplace, causing the nose to twitch, and the morning light glistens like fire on the gold, silver and jade jewelry that is being carefully laid out by watchful merchants. Deckhands and laborers will be busy unloading the cargoes far into the evening, grabbing a few hours of sleep before the whole cycle begins anew tomorrow.\n\nWhile some find the endless commotion of the harbor to be unsettling and overwhelming, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] revels in the chaos, knowing that it is a sign of a growing economy."

me_joseon_11_desc: "Although we have clashed with some of the Chinese people in the past - everyone famously knows of our conflicts with the #E Yan#! to the west - there are aspects of their culture and civilization that compliment our own.\n\nAs our trading connections with the #E Qi#! have proven, there is much to be gained from studying the ways of our neighbors.\n\nSome have balked at what [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has suggested, claiming that abandoning our traditional gods is a step too far, but no one remains in #E Joseon#! who can question the orders of our ruler."

We can either allow Joseon to garrison our cities, effectively becoming a vassal, or we can watch helplessly as their soldiers slaughter our families.\n\nNot much of a choice, but one that we have to make, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]."
