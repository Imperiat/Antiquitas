rel_flavor_kemetic.8.t:0 "A Mystic Has Been Found"
rel_flavor_kemetic.8.desc:0 "A local mystic in [country_province.GetName] has been found! His teachings, which he shares in simple, direct language, have guided the local people to prosperity for decades, who venerate him as almost a semi-divine being.

rel_flavor_kemetic.9.desc_1:0 "Amun-Ra who hears the prayer, who comes at the cry of the poor and distressed...beware of him! Repeat him to son and daughter, to great and small; relate him to generations of generations who have not yet come into being; relate him to fishes in the deep, to birds in heaven; repeat him to him who does not know him and to him who knows him ... Though it may be that the servant is normal in doing wrong, yet the Lord is normal in being merciful. The Lord of Thebes does not spend an entire day angry. As for his anger...in the completion of a moment, there is no remnant. Holding a national festival in honor of the great Amun has been suggested by the High Priest."
rel_flavor_kemetic.9.desc_2:0 "Osiris is the god of fertility, agriculture, the afterlife, the dead, resurrection, life, and vegetation in Kemetic religion. He is depicted as a green-skinned deity with a Pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive atef crown, and holding a symbolic crook and flail. A national celebration in the honor of Osiris should be held in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."
rel_flavor_kemetic.9.desc_3:0 "The Pyramid Texts describe the nature of the Pharaoh in different characters as both Horus and Osiris. The Pharaoh as Horus in life becomes the Pharaoh as Osiris in death, where he is united with the other gods. New incarnations of Horus succeeded the deceased Pharaoh on earth in the form of new Pharaohs. We should honor the life of the great Pharaoh by holding a grand religious festival in the name of Horus."
rel_flavor_kemetic.9.desc_4:0 "The sun is the giver of life, controlling the ripening of crops which are worked by man. Because of the life-giving qualities of the sun, Egyptians worship the fiery orb as the god Ra. Holding a national religious festival for Ra will ensure our prosperity in the coming years."

rel_flavor_kemetic.10.t:0 "The Amulet of Ra"
rel_flavor_kemetic.10.desc:0 "One of the rare pleasures that [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] indulges in is the collecting of fine antiquities and rarities, having developed a reputation as a fine appraiser of ancient treasures. Therefore, it is not very surprising that one day a wandering priest arrived at court with a relic to sell. It seems that [holy_man.GetName], a priest of Ra that lives in a small shrine far to the South, had a dream in which the god asked them to bring us an Amulet, one that he claims was personally given to Menes, the first Dynast to unite Egypt, by Ra himself. \n\nAfter a bit of haggling, the price of one hundred gold coins is reached."
rel_flavor_kemetic.10.a:0 "Purchase the Amulet"

rel_flavor_kemetic.11.desc:0 "Despite the overtures we have made to the local priesthood, there is still upheaval in [temple_province.GetName], as some of their leaders refuse to accept our sovereignty. This is a delicate situation, as we surely cannot afford to rile up the religious authorities, but so far, their hearts have not been softened by the generous gifts we keep sending to them. What should we do?"
rel_flavor_kemetic.11.a:0 "They won't get anything from [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName]"

We...hesitate to share the details of these dirty screeds, as our modesty prevents us from shaming ourselves before you, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], but we cannot let this bawdy scribe continue to pollute the populace with his filth - folks are complaining that we have allowed this to happen."

Normally, we offer gifts of beer and bread to the people, a burden that we are happy to shoulder, but the priests near [temple_province.GetName] are claiming that the peasants have been breaking into storage, helping themselves, and have even killed a priest that tried to stop the mob. While their economic situation is an unfortunate consequence of the wars we have waged, we cannot allow folks to act as common thieves- something should be done."

[bad_guy.GetName] claims that the Hour of Judgment approaches, and that Maat will only be restored once the armies of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] have been cast into oblivion. We are obviously very upset about this news and shouldn't tolerate this."
rel_flavor_kemetic.14.a:0 "Now is the time to act; Isfet must not prevail!"

The gods have taken an interest in us, and the good work that we have done near [deity_holy_site.GetName]. One night, the priest left the temple, but when they returned in the morning, they found overflowing baskets of coins at the base of the statues; it seems that the gods have literally given us a gift. What shall we do with this bounty?"
rel_flavor_kemetic.15.a:0 "[da_deity.GetName] is great!"
rel_flavor_kemetic.15.b:0 "Redirect the funds to the state"

rel_flavor_kemetic.18.desc:0 "It is known far and wide that the worshipers at [deity_holy_site.GetName] show their piety with monetary gifts, which has resulted in the local treasuries swelling. It would be a simple to thing for us to partake in this tradition, sending a few coins as a goodwill gesture, but we could also visit in person and see how much wealth they have accrued...aren't we owed a bit ourselves? Taking care of these temples is not cheap."
rel_flavor_kemetic.18.a:0 "Send even more offerings"

rel_flavor_kemetic.19.t:0 "Trouble at the Temple of Hatshepsu"
rel_flavor_kemetic.19.desc:0 "We have received messengers from the Temple of Hatshepsu, who have warned that the site is in bad shape. Bits of masonry have fallen from the ceilings, killing a local worshiper, and the desert sands gather around the monuments, threatening to bury them forever. It will require a good bit of coin and manpower to restore the Temple to what it once was, but it is also true that many have abandoned the region, believing that its best days are long gone. Is any of this worth the cost? This is the question we are faced with."

Now we have received word that the Priests of Thebes, unhappy with their current situation, have been causing trouble; saying that we have no divine right to rule over the Black Land. While this is undoubtedly annoying, we certainly have other, pressing matters that require your attention. What shall be done to these meddling priests?"
rel_flavor_kemetic.20.a:0 "Do nothing, but let them know I am unhappy"

It seems that the gods are returning to the land of Egypt, as the Apis Bull has been found for the first time in generations. A gathering of High Priests have completed their inspection of the bull, confirming that this magnificent beast truly is the Apis; all of the markings are present, including a white triangle on its forehead that is matched by twin crescents on either side. Wherever the Apis Bull goes, the faithful fall to their knees, weeping in joy and praising the gods for their mercies - the favor of the divine has been shown to us!"

rel_flavor_kemetic.23.desc:0 "One morning, [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] decided to go down to the Temple where the Apis Bull was residing, desiring to spend time with the divine creature. There is always a peaceful aura in the chamber where the Bull resides, as attendants wave large fans to keep the air circulating in the sanctuary while a musician plucks gently on a harp. The Apis Bull is reclining on all fours, eating dates out of the hand of a female slave, and it slowly turns to acknowledge [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s presence, bowing its head slightly."

rel_flavor_kemetic.25.desc:0 "In the middle of the night, disturbing dreams came for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. In the swirling sands of the desert there stood a great Temple, its large golden door covered with seals and curses that raised the hair on [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] neck.
