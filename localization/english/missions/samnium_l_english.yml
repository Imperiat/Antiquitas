 samnium_event.1001.t:0 "The Sacred Spring"
 samnium_event.1001.desc:0 "The Ver Sacrum - the rite of the #E Sacred Spring #! - has been called. An unusual human sacrifice, in a sense, in which children born in the spring are devoted to the rite. Upon their coming of age, they are sent into the wilderness to found a new community. \n\nThe practice is both a solution to overpopulation and a method of expansion, but is primarily an extreme sacrifice which is certain to gain the favor of the gods - or, at least, to convince our Samnite subjects that their favor has been gained. \n\nWe have seen fit to initiate this ancient and holy rite, and the chosen Samnites have already set out for the frontier."
