qin_01_shan_yang: "Shang Yang's Legacy"
qin_01_shan_yang_DESCRIPTION: "A mere generation ago there lived a lawyer and politician named Shang Yang, and although the circumstances of his birth placed him among the #E Wei#! people, his destiny would lead him to serve the #E Qin#! in a role as an influential advisor.\n\nDismayed by the corruption and weakness of the #E Zhou#! Dynasty, Shang Yang believed that the path forward would repudiate the ancient ways by reforming nearly every aspect of government. Soon, the military, economy, and bureaucracy were analyzed and dissected by the masterful strokes of Shang Yang's brush and ink, and although he is no longer with us, his writings lay out a vision that we must see come to pass."
qin_01_shan_yang_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the #E Qin#! have enacted all of the reforms proposed by the statesman Shang Yang."
qin_01_shan_yang_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "We must embrace Shang Yang to stand a chance!"

#Missions

qin_01_shan_yang_task_1: "Abrogate Fengjian"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_1_DESC: "The Fengjian feudal system has been the bedrock of Zhou dynasty governance for hundreds of years. However, this decentralized governing form flies in the face of Shang Yang's legalist reforms, which call for increased centralization. We should continue reforming away from feudal obligations as Shang Yang guided us to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_2: "Claim Yiqu"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_2_DESC: "We have a long history of fighting with the Rong that live in the territory claimed by the Yiqu, and because of this, it would be a trivial thing for us to claim the lands of the $anding_area$ and $tianshui_area$ region. We have every right to avenge our ancestors! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil3!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_3: "Neuter Yiqu"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_3_DESC: "We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past, and now that we have the Yiqu firmly in hand, we must suppress their culture and encourage their people to embrace ours. As any farmhand can tell you, a stallion that has been neutered is a much less dangerous one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil4!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_4: "Women's Militias"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_4_DESC: "The women in our cities are more than capable of guarding the city walls while the men fight in the field. Send word to the villages - they shall form militias to protect the home front. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil9!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_5: "Sechuan Assimilation"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_5_DESC: "Located in a strategic area on the periphery of our homeland, the Sechuan Basin is an incredibly important region that we would like to see developed, but we must first win over the people if we are to see our plans take root. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil2!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_6: "Curtail Aristocracy"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_6_DESC: "The growing powers of the aristocracy are an ever-present danger, and if we are not careful, we might discover that our greatest enemies are actually those claiming to be our fast friends...we must do something. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil7!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_7: "Civilize Sechuan"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_7_DESC: "Now that the locals have embraced our presence among them, they are amenable to the suggestions that we have regarding improving the local infrastructure. In time, this region will be as civilized as our own. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil13!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_7_qianwei_area: "We need one #Y City#! with over #Y 25 Pops#! and #Y 0 empty building slots#! in the #Y Qianwei#! area."

qin_01_shan_yang_task_8: "Meritocratic Promotion"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_8_DESC: "One of our greatest strengths is our willingness to promote skilled workers, regardless of the circumstances of their birth; we much prefer a system of meritocracy to the corrupt world of hereditary positions, where bribes are a way of life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil8!"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_8_trigger_tt: "The #Y Chancellor#!, #Y Steward#! and #Y Civic Researcher#! all have at least #Y 50 Statemanship#! and #Y 80 Loyalty#!."
qin_01_shan_yang_task_8_foreign_minister_check: "The #Y Chancellor#! must have at least #Y 50 Statemanship#! and #Y 80 Loyalty#!."

qin_01_shan_yang_task_9: "Absolute Authority"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_9_DESC: "Slowly, by degrees, we have consolidated our authority and limited the power of any dissenting voices that are left. Our firm hand now holds the reins of state, and our peerless example leads the nation forward. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil12!"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_9_req_tt: "All #Y Office Holders#! and #Y Heads of Great Families#! are #Y Loyal#!."

qin_01_shan_yang_task_10: "End of the Rong"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_10_DESC: "No more shall the presence of the Rong, our old foes, be found among our peoples - let their memories be extinguished forever, a swirling mote of dust lost in the sands of time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil10!"

qin_01_shan_yang_task_11: "Shang Yang's Legacy"
qin_01_shan_yang_task_11_DESC: "Although he is not around to observe the culmination of his vision, we rest secure in our total victory, knowing that Shang Yang would be pleased to see what we have accomplished with our reforms. All members of society, from the lowly plowman to the haughty bureacrat, have had their lives changed for the better. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil15!"
