Even now, as dusk gently wraps her fingers around the capital, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is there watching the legion, deeply engrossed in the combat taking place. Two of our best warriors are dueling, faces twisted in grim determination, as no one wishes to dishonor themselves before the watching eyes of the assembly.\n\n'There is an opening, Korei - strike!'
