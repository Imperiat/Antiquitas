However, a new power to the south is rising which, if left unchecked, could threaten our very existance. In order to counteract this threat, we must band together into a pan-Ligurian federation capable of fighting those who would subjugate us."

With the plateau firmly secured within the borders of our realm, we can proclaim a glorious Tibetan Empire capable of projecting power and influence from the top of the world!"
