 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission_DESCRIPTION:1 "Agathokles was beaten: his army destroyed at the Himera river, his city, Syracuse, besieged by our armies, his allies deserting him. We were the masters of Sicily. And then he did the unthinkable: with whatever he had left he crossed the sea and laid waste to our lands in Africa, finding support from both the Greeks from Cyrenaica as well as the Numidians living amongst us. Such was this disaster that we had to withdraw from Sicily to deal with him and lost our chance of dominating the Greeks of Sicily.\n"
 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:1 "Agathokles' invasion of Africa still haunts our people."
 carthaginian_aftermath_of_the_invasion_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:1 "Before we can think to expand across the seas again, we must strengthen our grasp on our home. Or else we are doomed to repeat our mistake.\n\nThis mission cannot be restarted at a later date."

 carthaginian_africa_invasion_megara_DESC:0 "Extending the walls not just across the isthmus, but also to encircle the plains on the peninsula north of the city, will greatly expand the size of the city. So much so that the land will not have to be filled with cramped urban dwellings to house all our people, but can instead house spacious villas and agricultural land.\n\nMegara will thus not just lead to an increase in the population of the city, but also secure a food supply in case of siege."

Though not jealously enough: on the sandy beaches of Greater Syrtis exists a lively trade in the herb between our and Cyrenaican traders.\n\nCharax has proven to be a favorite meeting spot of silphium smugglers.

And so it is with our noble subject Aelymas, Agellid of the Mideni.\n\nWhen Agathokles invaded our lands, Aelymas foolishly rebelled and tried to side with the invader, only to experience their cruelty first hand when Agathokles took his capital Thugga. Defeated, Aelymas turned to us for protection against the tyrant.
