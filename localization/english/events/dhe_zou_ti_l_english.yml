Much to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s surprise, the old sage was wiping a tear from his cheeks and dabbing a small cloth at his nose.\n\nKnocking gently on the door, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] stepped forward and spoke in a soft voice. 'Pray tell me, dear Mencius, what bothers you on this fine day? It's too early to be saddened.'\n\nRising to his feet, [GetCharacter('(int32)618').GetFirstName] adjusted his robes before bowing deeply. 'Forgive the sentimentality of an old man, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], but I am shedding tears of joy, for at this very moment, I have completed a long text that I have been working on for many years.\n\nGesturing towards the scrolls behind him, [GetCharacter('(int32)618').GetName] allowed a smile to crease his wrinkled face. 'My life's work, complete.'"

 dhe_zou_ti.3.t: "Commune of Xu Xing"
 dhe_zou_ti.3.desc: "It is known by all that the ruler of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] seeks to be a faithful steward of the land, but shamefully, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has yet to hear the Way that is taught by [GetCharacter('(int32)654').GetName], a true believer in the goodness of man and the stability brought to the realm by solid agricultural policies.\n\nFor, as [GetCharacter('(int32)654').GetFirstName] teaches, a wise ruler tills the land together with his people to make his living, and he governs while cooking his own meals - a good ruler leads by example and is not afraid to get his hands dirty with the rich black soil of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName].\n\nBut as the economy of Teng grows, and granaries and treasuries of stone are constructed to hold the gold and silver of an increasingly wealthy land, temptations abound, and an unworthy [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] inflicts hardship on the people to fatten himself up...indeed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is not blameless of walking upright at all times, but has enriched [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]self at various opportunities.\n\nIn response to this state of affairs, a commune that shares the teachings of [GetCharacter('(int32)654').GetFirstName] has been formed near the capital, and many of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people, including [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], have been known to attend the lectures given by the sage."
