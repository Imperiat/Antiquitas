 mandate_events.1.t: "Yellow River Dikes"
 mandate_events.1.desc: "Preparing for the seasonal flooding of the Yellow river is one of the oldest and most important duties of any state in Northern China. Our officials have identified an area that has suffered in particular during the last few years. It would blossom if we could only stop the water from threatening the livelihood of the locals."
 mandate_events.1.a: "This will surely please the officials!"
 mandate_events.1.b: "Alas we have no money to spare."
 
 mandate_events.2.t: "A Gift"
 mandate_events.2.desc: "One of our most respected courtiers has presented us with an expensive gift in the form of an enormous and carefully constructed countryside manor. Though nothing compared to the Imperial treasury, the gift is quite grand and it is clear to any observer that the donee must be expecting to get something in return..."
 mandate_events.2.a: "We must accept this offering!"
 mandate_events.2.b: "We cannot risk our reputation."
 
 mandate_events.3.t: "Quick-Fingered Treasurer"
 mandate_events.3.desc: "Money has been mysteriously disappearing from the Imperial treasury for some time now, and you have started to direct your suspicions to a court official employed as a treasury book keeper."
 mandate_events.3.a: "Execute him!"
 mandate_events.3.b: "Best to keep quiet about this."
 
 mandate_events.4.t: "Trade Regulations"
 mandate_events.4.desc: "It seems the local officials of [target_province.GetName] have taken it upon themselves to stimulate local commerce. A series of regulations issued have, while quite contrary to official policy, managed to provoke a local trade boom, with many local families getting into lucrative business while also attracting foreign merchants from overseas. Our advisors are, however, imploring us to shut them down and retract the local stipulations as they are an affront to good governance and central power."
 mandate_events.4.a: "I am sure the people best know how to rule themselves."
 mandate_events.4.b: "We cannot let this slip past us!"
 
 mandate_trade_regulations_mod: "Local Trade Regulations"
 mandate_trade_regulations_neg_mod: "Trade Office Closed Down"
 
 mandate_events.5.t: "The Isolation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]"
 mandate_events.5.desc: "By employing a tactic of constantly tailing the Emperor and building trust with him at every opportunity, court factions have managed to outmaneuver several previously influential courtiers and are increasingly gaining influence over the day to day palatial rulings."
 mandate_events.5.a: "He is clearly getting good advice."
 mandate_events.5.b: "He takes advice from no one!"
 
 mandate_events.6.t: "The Levy Of [target_province.GetName]"
 mandate_events.6.desc: "Officials have undertaken a project to expand the levy in [target_province.GetName] by improving and updating the local censuses. The reform promises to bring additional manpower to the Imperial Army, and improve the province's future troop recruitment. Other administrators, however, would argue that leaving the locals alone would likely increase the value of the province more long term."
 mandate_events.6.a: "Naturally these reforms are called for."
 mandate_events.6.b: "No need to harass the peasantry."
 
 mandate_events.7.t: "Retainer Flogged"
 mandate_events.7.desc: "A high ranking official has earned himself a reputation for cruelty since taking to regularly flogging a particular retainer of his, of whom he seems to have a particular distaste. While he is fully within his rights to punish his lessers, this has caused something of a scandal and people generally feel that his treatment could benefit from a little moderation."
 mandate_events.7.a: "He's setting an excellent example!"
 mandate_events.7.b: "Relieve the Official."
 
 mandate_events.8.t: "Gold Mine Discovered"
 mandate_events.8.desc: "A gold mine has been discovered in one of our provinces by a young official. Exploiting this new and rich lode may seem like a foregone conclusion, but some warn against the venture, citing concerns over a potential overextension of the money supply."
 mandate_events.8.a: "Dig deep and greedily!"
 mandate_events.8.b: "Let sleeping dogs lie."
 
 mandate_events.9.t: "Bullion Leaves the Country"
 mandate_events.9.desc: "It has been discovered that large amounts of bronze bullion have left the country on the various trade barges. Palatial bureaucrats are in animated discussions about how this has come to be. Accusations are being thrown around against local and central officials alike. The only agreement of the day seems to be that the exodus of wealth must be stopped."
 mandate_events.9.a: "Blame the local officials."
 mandate_events.9.b: "Renew efforts to import bullion."

 mandate_events.10.a: "Naturally we shall restore it."
 mandate_events.10.b: "We have no time for such nonsense."
