 flavor_cap.1.t:0 "Chaos in Cappadocia!"
 flavor_cap.1.desc:0 "Though for many years Cappadocia had been under Persian control, the region has been firmly in the Hellenic hands following Alexander the Great's conquests. Under the rule of the Satrap Eumenes of Cardia, the province would fight for control and greater glory during the Wars of the Diadochi... Eumenes deftly commanded many Macedonian soldiers, including the famed Silver Shields, despite not being of their culture. It was through hard work, determination, and intelligent command that he won their respect. This new-found power of Eumenes would be cut short however. At the Battle of Gabiene, Eumenes had ultimately won the battle, but lost control of his army. He would be betrayed by the Silver Shields, whose families were held hostage by Antigonos I Monophthalmos. In the end, Eumenes would be imprisoned by the Antigonid forces and die to starvation. His remains were sent back to his family, while the Macedonian family Amyntid, ever loyal to the Antigonid cause, would be instated as the new Satraps of Cappadocia. \n \nOne might think that the situation would have calmed down, but one would be sorely mistaken. The Amyntid's rule is by no means secure; On the one hand, the son of the former Persian King, Ariarathes II, plans to retake his homeland and drive out the Hellenes from the region. On the other hand, the children of Eumenes of Cardia, plot and scheme to avenge their father. The eldest son, Eumenes, desires retake control over Cappadocia and defeat the Antigonids in battle. Cappadocia stands upon the edge of precipice. What path will Cappadocia tread?"
 flavor_cap.1.a:0 "The Eumenids are our rightful rulers!"
 flavor_cap.1.b:0 "Ariarathes' claim holds true!"
 flavor_cap.1.c:0 "By right of conquest, we serve the Antigonids!"
 flavor_cap.2.t:0 "Coup in Cappadocia!"
 flavor_cap.2.desc:0 "With the defeat of the infamous General and Satrap, Eumenes of Cardia, we have been able to conquer the Satrapy of Cappadocia. Unfortunately, it seems like our loyal Macedonian satrapy has been usurped!  A coup has taken place in Mazaká and the son of our rival Eumenes has taken control and proclaimed himself Basileus! At the moment, we are surrounded by enemies on all fronts. Perhaps it would be wiser for us to abandon our influence in the region and first take care of the other Diadochi. After they have been dealt with, we can move into the lost satrapy and take back what is rightfully ours!  Alternatively, we could turn our full attention to them and strike them now!  Shall we end this rebellious act and put a nail in the coffin of the Eumenid dynasty?  What shall it be; war or peace?"
 flavor_cap.2.a:0 "Peace is the only way, we are too occupied on other fronts!"
 flavor_cap.2.b:0 "We will crush the rebellion with one swift stroke!"
 flavor_cap.4.t:0 "Our rule is strengthened in Cappadocia"
 flavor_cap.4.desc:0 "Great news Basileus! Reports have arrived from Cappadocia proclaiming our forces have won struggle for control over the rebellious satrapy. We can now finally focus on other matters."
 flavor_cap.4.a:0 "Cappadocia is finally secure!"
 flavor_cap.5.t:0 "Coup in Cappadocia!"
 flavor_cap.5.desc:0 "Word has reached us that the heir of old king Ariarathes, Ariarathes II, has taken control of the Satrapy of Cappadocia with support from the nearby kingdom of Armenia. This will not stand!  We could pressure the Armenians to drop their support for this new King, thus paving the way to reexert our control, or we could settle the dispute by abandoning Cappadocia for the time being...at least until we have defeated the remaining Diadochi. Once they are defeated, we will return and retake what is rightfully ours!"
 flavor_cap.5.a:0 "The answer is clear! We shall focus on them later..."
 flavor_cap.5.b:0 "We will crush the rebellion with one swift stroke!"
