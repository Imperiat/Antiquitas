# achievements are unlocked by setting a variable, either through on_actions, events in missions or manually, by pressing the re-check button in the sgui
# is_shown block shows whether achievement is unlocked
# is_valid block shows whether it is possible to unlock it in this campaign at all
# currently, I don't show the tooltip with conditions for every achievement, like vanilla, only for the impossible ones. If needed, I can add later
