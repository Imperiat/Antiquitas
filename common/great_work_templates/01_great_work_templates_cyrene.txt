# Invictus, Matt Alexi's contribution
#	The purpose of this file is for these wonders to be available to spawn via events

# Notes for setup\main\02_great_works_modded.txt (the file doesn't handle notes):
#	added ancient wonders
#	The Numidian Tomb is removed because it is outside the bookmark.
#	The Athens Academy is removed for use as an event wonder.
#	ToDo: issues with visibilty of Athens Academy and Knossos Palace.
